# Grainline

A woodworking marketplace built with Next.js, similar to Etsy/Amazon but focused on woodworking makers and their products. Sellers can list items, appear as pins on a local map, and receive payments via Stripe Connect.

## Design System

Visual standards for all UI work on this codebase. Do not deviate without explicit instruction.

### Colors

- **Page background**: `bg-[#F7F5F0]` (warm cream `#F7F5F0`) — creates contrast against `#ffffff` card surfaces
- **Card surface**: `bg-white` (`#ffffff`) — all card info sections, never `bg-stone-50` or any grey tint
- **Borders**: `border-stone-200/60` on cards; `border-neutral-200` on inputs and buttons
- **Text primary**: `text-neutral-900`; secondary: `text-neutral-500`; muted: `text-neutral-400`
- **Accent**: amber — `bg-amber-50`, `border-amber-200`, `text-amber-700` for highlights/badges

### Card Classes (defined in `src/app/globals.css`)

- **`.card-listing`** — listing cards: `background: #fff`, `border: 1px solid rgba(214,211,209,0.6)`, warm box-shadow `0 8px 30px rgba(28,25,23,0.04)`, `border-radius: 0.5rem` (8px), `overflow: hidden`, `hover:shadow-md`, `transition: box-shadow 0.2s`
- **`.card-section`** — content/info blocks: same border + shadow, no hover effect, no overflow:hidden

### Rounding

- **Cards**: `rounded-lg` (8px) via `.card-listing` / `.card-section`
- **Buttons & inputs**: `rounded-md` (6px) — enforced via `button { border-radius: 0.375rem }` global CSS base style in `globals.css`
- **Pills & tags**: `rounded-full` only — never on buttons or cards

### Typography

- **`.font-display`** — `font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; letter-spacing: -0.025em` — applies ONLY to `<h1>` page titles and `<h2>` section headings. Never on card text, prices, nav links, buttons, or metadata.
- **Section headings with `.font-display`**: Browse h1, Commission Room h1, My Account h1/h2s, Your Feed h1, Workshop h1, Messages h1, Listing detail "About this piece" / "Details" / "You might also like" h2s, Dashboard h2s

### Card Image Standards

- **Grid cards** (`card-listing`): `aspect-[4/3] object-cover` — no fixed heights
- **List card thumbnail** (browse list view): full-height left column (`relative w-40 sm:w-48` parent, `absolute inset-0 h-full w-full object-cover` image) — expands to match the text content height
- **Blog/feed cards**: `aspect-[4/3] object-cover`

### Purchase Panel (listing detail)

- Price: `text-3xl font-semibold`
- Buy Now: full-width black button, `rounded-md`, `py-3 min-h-[44px]`
- Add to Cart: full-width bordered button, `rounded-md`
- Seller card: 56px avatar, display name + GuildBadge, tagline, star rating + count, city/state with MapPin icon, "Visit Shop" + Follow + Message in a row

### Icons

- SVG icon components from `src/components/icons/` for all structural/navigational UI
- Category tiles: SVG icons at `size=28`, `bg-stone-100` tile, `text-stone-600` icon
- Section headings: clean `.font-display` serif text only — no inline icons (icons were removed from "Fresh from the Workshop" and "Buyer Favorites" headings for cleaner appearance)
- No emoji in headings or navigation

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16.2.4 (App Router), React 19.2.5, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: Clerk (`@clerk/nextjs`)
- **Payments**: Stripe + Stripe Connect (seller payouts)
- **File Upload**: UploadThing
- **Maps**: Leaflet / React-Leaflet
- **Email**: Resend
- **Shipping**: Shippo API (live rate quotes and label generation)
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry (error tracking + performance monitoring)

## Key Data Models

- **User** — authenticated account (linked to Clerk user ID); `role`: `USER | EMPLOYEE | ADMIN` (used for admin panel access control); `banned Boolean @default(false)`, `bannedAt DateTime?`, `banReason String?`, `bannedBy String?` — ban fields set by admin
- **SellerProfile** — seller info, location (lat/lng for map), Stripe Connect account, shipping config; `onboardingStep Int @default(0)`, `onboardingComplete Boolean @default(false)` track wizard progress
- **Listing** — product for sale; status: `DRAFT | ACTIVE | SOLD | SOLD_OUT | HIDDEN | PENDING_REVIEW`; `listingType`: `MADE_TO_ORDER | IN_STOCK`; includes `processingTimeMinDays`, `processingTimeMaxDays` (MADE_TO_ORDER only), `stockQuantity Int?` and `shipsWithinDays Int?` (IN_STOCK only); `isReadyToShip` fully removed. Also has `category Category?`, `viewCount Int @default(0)`, `clickCount Int @default(0)`. Stock is decremented at checkout (Stripe webhook) and restored on case refund resolution. Custom order fields: `isPrivate Boolean @default(false)`, `reservedForUserId String?` (back-relation `reservedForUser User? @relation("ReservedListings")`), `customOrderConversationId String?`.
- **Order** — purchase transaction with Stripe refs, shipping/tax amounts, fulfillment tracking, quoted address snapshot (`quotedTo*` fields), mismatch detection flag (`reviewNeeded`), Shippo label fields, `estimatedDeliveryDate`, and `processingDeadline` (see below)
- **OrderItem** — line items in an order; `listingSnapshot Json?` — snapshot of listing data captured at checkout (title, description, priceCents, imageUrls, category, tags, sellerName, capturedAt)
- **AdminAuditLog** — `id`, `adminId` → `User @relation("AdminActions")`, `action`, `targetType`, `targetId`, `reason?`, `metadata Json @default("{}")`, `undone Boolean @default(false)`, `undoneAt?`, `undoneBy?`, `undoneReason?`, `createdAt`; `@@index([adminId])`, `@@index([targetType, targetId])`, `@@index([createdAt])`, `@@index([undone])`; back-relation `adminActions AdminAuditLog[] @relation("AdminActions")` on `User`. Migration: `20260401011017_ban_audit_ai_review_snapshot`
- **Cart / CartItem** — per-user shopping cart
- **Conversation / Message** — buyer-seller messaging, optionally tied to a listing; `Message` has `kind String?` for structured message types (`custom_order_request`, `custom_order_link`, `file`)
- **Review / ReviewPhoto / ReviewVote** — reviews with photos, seller replies, helpfulness voting
- **Favorite** — saved/bookmarked listings
- **SavedSearch** — per-user saved browse filters (query, category, minPrice, maxPrice, tags array); shown in dashboard; created via `POST /api/search/saved`
- **MakerVerification** — `id`, `sellerProfileId` (unique), `craftDescription`, `yearsExperience`, `portfolioUrl?`, `status VerificationStatus @default(PENDING)`, `reviewedById?`, `reviewNotes?`, `appliedAt`, `reviewedAt?`; back-relations on `SellerProfile` (optional 1:1) and `User` (`verificationReviews @relation("VerificationReviews")`). `VerificationStatus` enum: `PENDING | APPROVED | REJECTED`. Migration: `20260327212938_add_maker_verification`
- **BlogPost / BlogComment / NewsletterSubscriber** — see Blog System section below. Migrations: `20260327215946_add_blog_system`
- **Notification** — `id`, `userId` → `User`, `type NotificationType`, `title`, `body`, `link String?`, `read Boolean @default(false)`, `createdAt`; `@@index([userId, read])`; back-relation `notifications Notification[]` on `User`. Migration: `20260328_add_notifications` (planned; enum + model added). `createNotification(userId, type, title, body, link?)` helper in `src/lib/notifications.ts` wired in 14 places across the app.
- **SiteConfig** — singleton (id=1) storing `fallbackShippingCents` used when Shippo returns no rates
- **Case** — buyer dispute tied 1:1 to an Order; tracks `reason`, `status`, `resolution`, Stripe refund ID, `sellerRespondBy` deadline, `discussionStartedAt`, `escalateUnlocksAt`, `buyerMarkedResolved`, `sellerMarkedResolved`
- **CaseMessage** — threaded messages on a Case (buyer, seller, or staff)

Fulfillment enums: `FulfillmentMethod` (PICKUP | SHIPPING), `FulfillmentStatus` (PENDING | READY_FOR_PICKUP | PICKED_UP | SHIPPED | DELIVERED)

`Category` enum: `FURNITURE | KITCHEN | DECOR | TOOLS | TOYS | JEWELRY | ART | OUTDOOR | STORAGE | OTHER` — display labels in `src/lib/categories.ts` (`CATEGORY_LABELS`, `CATEGORY_VALUES`). **Always use `CATEGORY_VALUES.includes(raw)` to validate — never `Object.values(Category)` which crashes in RSC if Prisma enum is undefined at runtime.** Current display labels: TOOLS → "Home & Office", STORAGE → "Gifts" (updated 2026-04-01).

`ListingStatus` enum: `DRAFT | ACTIVE | SOLD | SOLD_OUT | HIDDEN | PENDING_REVIEW | REJECTED`

`ListingType` enum: `MADE_TO_ORDER | IN_STOCK`

`LabelStatus` enum: `PURCHASED | EXPIRED | VOIDED`

`CaseReason` enum: `NOT_RECEIVED | NOT_AS_DESCRIBED | DAMAGED | WRONG_ITEM | OTHER`

`CaseStatus` enum: `OPEN | IN_DISCUSSION | PENDING_CLOSE | UNDER_REVIEW | RESOLVED | CLOSED`

`CaseResolution` enum: `REFUND_FULL | REFUND_PARTIAL | DISMISSED`

`NotificationType` enum (22 values): `NEW_MESSAGE | NEW_ORDER | ORDER_SHIPPED | ORDER_DELIVERED | CASE_OPENED | CASE_MESSAGE | CASE_RESOLVED | CUSTOM_ORDER_REQUEST | CUSTOM_ORDER_LINK | VERIFICATION_APPROVED | VERIFICATION_REJECTED | BACK_IN_STOCK | NEW_REVIEW | LOW_STOCK | NEW_FAVORITE | NEW_BLOG_COMMENT | BLOG_COMMENT_REPLY | NEW_FOLLOWER | FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_LISTING | FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_BLOG | SELLER_BROADCAST | COMMISSION_INTEREST | LISTING_APPROVED | LISTING_REJECTED`

### Order — delivery estimate fields

`estimatedDeliveryDate` and `processingDeadline` are calculated in the Stripe webhook when an order is created:

- `processingDeadline` = order creation time + `maxProcessingDays` days (max of all items' `processingTimeMaxDays`, default 3)
- `estimatedDeliveryDate` = `processingDeadline` + `estDays` (from `shipping_rate_data.metadata.estDays` stored at checkout, default 7) + 3 grace days

`estDays` is stored in `shipping_rate_data.metadata` by both checkout routes alongside `objectId`.

### Order — Shippo label fields

These fields are written to `Order` after checkout completes (via the Stripe webhook):

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `shippoShipmentId` | Returned by `shippoRatesMultiPiece`, stored in Stripe session metadata, read in webhook |
| `shippoRateObjectId` | Rate's `objectId` stored in `shipping_rate_data.metadata` on Stripe, read from expanded `shipping_cost.shipping_rate.metadata.objectId` in webhook |
| `shippoTransactionId` | Set when a label is purchased via `POST /api/orders/[id]/label` |
| `labelUrl` | Shippo label PDF URL, written on label purchase |
| `labelCarrier` | Carrier for purchased label |
| `labelTrackingNumber` | Tracking number for purchased label |
| `labelPurchasedAt` | Timestamp of label purchase |
| `labelCostCents` | Cost of purchased label in cents |
| `labelStatus` | `LabelStatus` enum value |

## Label Purchase Flow

`POST /api/orders/[id]/label` (`src/app/api/orders/[id]/label/route.ts`) handles the full label purchase lifecycle:

1. **Auth** — verifies the requesting user is a seller who owns the order (same pattern as the fulfillment route).
2. **Guard rails** — returns 400 if `labelStatus = PURCHASED` or `fulfillmentStatus` is already `SHIPPED`, `DELIVERED`, or `PICKED_UP`.
3. **Rate resolution** — picks the rate objectId to use in this order:
   - Caller-supplied `rateObjectId` in the request body (used after a re-quote rate-picker selection) takes priority
   - Falls back to `order.shippoRateObjectId` if the order is under 5 days old
   - Otherwise triggers a re-quote (see below)
4. **Re-quote path** — calls `shippoRatesMultiPiece` using the order's saved `shipTo*` address and item dimensions, runs through `prioritizeAndTrim(rates, 4)`, persists the new `shippoShipmentId`, and returns `{ requiresRateSelection: true, rates }` with HTTP 202.
5. **Label purchase** — calls `POST /transactions/` on Shippo with `{ rate, label_file_type: "PDF", async: false }`. On success, writes all label fields to the Order and sets `fulfillmentStatus = SHIPPED`.
6. **Stripe clawback** — calls `stripe.transfers.createReversal(order.stripeTransferId, { amount: labelCostCents })` to deduct the label cost from the seller's payout. Wrapped in try/catch so a Stripe failure doesn't roll back a successful label purchase.

### LabelSection UI (`src/components/LabelSection.tsx`)

Client component rendered in the seller order detail page (`src/app/dashboard/sales/[orderId]/page.tsx`) for non-pickup shipping orders. Three render states:

- **Purchased** — green "Download Label" button opening `labelUrl` in a new tab, plus carrier, tracking number, and purchase timestamp.
- **Rate picker** (shown after a 202 re-quote response) — radio list of up to 4 rates showing carrier, service, estimated days, and cost. Confirming a selection re-calls the label route with `{ rateObjectId }`.
- **Default** (no label yet, order not yet shipped) — "Purchase Label" button with an estimated cost note derived from `shippingAmountCents`.

The existing "Mark as Shipped" manual tracking form remains below, under the heading "Already shipped? Enter tracking manually".

## Case / Dispute System

Five API routes handle the full case lifecycle:

| Route | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/cases` | Buyer | Opens a case. Validates buyer owns order, delivery date is in the past, no existing case. Sets `sellerRespondBy` to 48h from now. Creates Case + initial CaseMessage. |
| `POST /api/cases/[id]/messages` | Buyer, seller, or staff | Adds a message to the thread. Blocks on RESOLVED/CLOSED cases. When seller posts first reply on OPEN case: sets `IN_DISCUSSION`, `discussionStartedAt`, `escalateUnlocksAt = now + 48h`. |
| `POST /api/cases/[id]/escalate` | Buyer/seller (if `escalateUnlocksAt` past) or staff/CRON_SECRET | `id="all"` bulk-escalates OPEN cases past `sellerRespondBy` (staff/cron only). Single ID: buyer/seller may escalate after `escalateUnlocksAt`; sets `UNDER_REVIEW`. |
| `POST /api/cases/[id]/mark-resolved` | Buyer or seller | Marks their side resolved. First call → `PENDING_CLOSE`. Both calls → `RESOLVED` with `DISMISSED`. |
| `POST /api/cases/[id]/resolve` | EMPLOYEE or ADMIN | Accepts `resolution` + optional `refundAmountCents`. Issues Stripe refund (full with `reason: "fraudulent"`, partial by amount). Stamps `stripeRefundId`, sets case RESOLVED, flags order `reviewNeeded`. |

### Seller self-service refund

`POST /api/orders/[id]/refund` lets sellers issue refunds directly:
- Auth: verifies requesting user is a seller who owns items in the order
- Body: `{ type: "FULL" | "PARTIAL", amountCents?: number }`
- Issues Stripe refund with `refund_application_fee: true` + `reverse_transfer: true` — proportional platform fee returned to seller, refund comes from seller's Stripe balance (not platform). Manual `transfers.createReversal` removed (handled by `reverse_transfer` flag).
- Restores stock for IN_STOCK items on FULL refund
- Atomically resolves any open case as REFUND_FULL or REFUND_PARTIAL

**Refund flags** (audited 2026-04-15): both refund routes (`/api/orders/[id]/refund` + `/api/cases/[id]/resolve`) now include `refund_application_fee: true` and `reverse_transfer: true`. Without these, platform keeps fee on refunds (unfair to seller) and refund comes from platform balance (wrong).

**Gift wrap fee**: excluded from platform fee base — gift wrap is a seller-provided service added as separate Stripe line item. Platform fee applies only to product items.
- Stamps `order.sellerRefundId`, `order.sellerRefundAmountCents`, `reviewNeeded = true`

`SellerRefundPanel` client component (`src/components/SellerRefundPanel.tsx`) is rendered in the seller order detail page above fulfillment actions. Shows already-issued refund notice if `sellerRefundId` is set; otherwise offers Full Refund / Partial Refund buttons.

### CaseStatus flow

`OPEN` → (seller replies) → `IN_DISCUSSION` → (one party marks resolved) → `PENDING_CLOSE` → (other party confirms) → `RESOLVED`

Either party may escalate to `UNDER_REVIEW` once `escalateUnlocksAt` (48h after discussion starts) has passed. Staff/cron may escalate at any time.

Listing type and availability is surfaced on listing pages: green "In Stock (N available)" badge for IN_STOCK with quantity > 0, red "Out of Stock" badge (buy buttons disabled) for IN_STOCK with quantity = 0 or status SOLD_OUT, "Made to order — ships in X–Y days" (or plain "Made to order") for MADE_TO_ORDER. Sellers set it via `ListingTypeFields` client component (`src/components/ListingTypeFields.tsx`) in the create/edit listing forms. `ProcessingTimeFields.tsx` has been replaced.

## Case / Dispute UI (complete)

All case UI is implemented end-to-end:

- **Buyer** — `src/app/dashboard/orders/[id]/page.tsx`: "Open a Case" button (via `OpenCaseForm`) when eligible; case thread + `CaseReplyBox` for OPEN/IN_DISCUSSION/PENDING_CLOSE; `CaseMarkResolvedButton` for IN_DISCUSSION/PENDING_CLOSE; `CaseEscalateButton` when `escalateUnlocksAt` has passed; "Waiting for seller" message when buyer has marked resolved
- **Seller** — `src/app/dashboard/sales/[orderId]/page.tsx`: status banner (amber=OPEN, blue=IN_DISCUSSION, teal=PENDING_CLOSE, purple=UNDER_REVIEW); full message thread; `CaseReplyBox` for OPEN/IN_DISCUSSION/PENDING_CLOSE; `CaseMarkResolvedButton` + `CaseEscalateButton`; "Waiting for buyer" message; `SellerRefundPanel` above fulfillment actions
- **Admin** — `src/app/admin/cases/page.tsx`: paginated queue sorted active-first, status filter tabs (including IN_DISCUSSION and PENDING_CLOSE), count badge in sidebar (`layout.tsx` counts OPEN+IN_DISCUSSION+PENDING_CLOSE+UNDER_REVIEW); `src/app/admin/cases/[id]/page.tsx`: full detail with `CaseResolutionPanel` (full refund, partial refund, dismiss) and staff reply box

Client components: `OpenCaseForm`, `CaseReplyBox`, `CaseResolutionPanel`, `CaseEscalateButton`, `CaseMarkResolvedButton`, `SellerRefundPanel`

## Search & Browse

The browse page (`src/app/browse/page.tsx`) is a full-featured search experience:

- **Filters**: category select, listing type (IN_STOCK / MADE_TO_ORDER), ships-within days, min/max price, sort (relevance / newest / price / popular), tags (via URL `tag=` params), location radius (Haversine raw SQL on SellerProfile lat/lng), min rating
- **Relevance sort**: fetches up to 200 results, scores in JS (`favCount×0.3 + viewCount×0.1 + recency×0.2 − soldOut×0.5`), then paginates
- **Standard sorts**: Prisma pagination; `popular` uses `{ favorites: { _count: 'desc' } }`
- **No-results**: shows featured listings (most favorited), popular tag suggestions, browse-all link
- **Layout**: two-column flex — `FilterSidebar` (sticky aside, mobile drawer) + main grid; grid/list toggle via `view` URL param
- **ClickTracker** (`src/components/ClickTracker.tsx`) — "use client" `<li>` wrapper that fires `POST /api/listings/[id]/click` on click (fire-and-forget). Used on: browse grid/list cards, homepage Fresh from the Workshop cards, homepage Buyer Favorites cards, homepage From Your Makers listing cards, `SimilarItems`, seller profile Featured Work cards, seller profile All Listings cards, seller shop grid cards, account saved items scroll row, account/saved listings grid
- **SaveSearchButton** (`src/components/SaveSearchButton.tsx`) — "use client", reads `useSearchParams`, POSTs to `/api/search/saved`; redirects to sign-in if not logged in
- **FilterSidebar** (`src/components/FilterSidebar.tsx`) — "use client", reads `useSearchParams`, uses `key={searchParams.toString()}` form trick for `defaultValue` sync

### Search suggestions / autocomplete

`GET /api/search/suggestions?q=` returns up to 8 deduplicated suggestions from 4 parallel queries:
1. Listing title substring matches (ILIKE) — filtered `seller: { chargesEnabled: true }`
2. Tag partial matches via `unnest(tags) ILIKE` (raw SQL, `INNER JOIN "SellerProfile" sp ON sp.id = l."sellerId"`, `AND sp."chargesEnabled" = true`)
3. Seller displayName matches — not filtered by chargesEnabled (sellers appear regardless)
4. Fuzzy title matches via `similarity(title, q) > 0.25` (pg_trgm) — same `INNER JOIN` + chargesEnabled filter

Plus category label matches from `CATEGORY_VALUES`.

`SearchBar` (`src/components/SearchBar.tsx`) — "use client" header component with 300ms debounce, dropdown, Escape/click-outside dismiss, `onMouseDown + e.preventDefault()` on suggestion buttons to avoid blur-before-click race. **Suggestions trigger at 2 characters** (was 3). **Popular tags on focus**: when the input is focused and empty, fetches `GET /api/search/popular-tags` (ISR 1hr, top 8 by active listing count) and shows them as a "Popular searches" section above regular suggestions; loaded once per session (`popularLoaded` guard).

`GET /api/search/popular-tags` — public route, ISR cached 1 hour (`export const revalidate = 3600`); raw SQL `unnest(tags)` grouped by count on ACTIVE non-private listings; returns `{ tags: string[] }` (up to 8). Used only by `SearchBar`.

`GET /api/search/popular-blog-tags` — public route, ISR cached 1 hour; raw SQL `unnest(tags)` grouped by count on PUBLISHED blog posts; returns `{ tags: string[] }` (up to 8). Used by `BlogSearchBar` — shows popular blog topics, not listing tags.

**Category suggestions** — `GET /api/search/suggestions` now also returns `categories: { value, label }[]` (structured, for routing to `/browse?category=VALUE`). Category labels remain in the flat `suggestions` string array for backward compatibility. `SearchBar` renders a "Categories" section in the dropdown between popular tags and text suggestions. `BlogSearchBar` shows popular blog topics on focus (navigating to `/blog?bq=...&sort=relevant`).

### Analytics fields

- `viewCount` — incremented by `POST /api/listings/[id]/view` (24h `httpOnly` cookie deduplication). `ListingViewTracker` ("use client") fires this on mount from listing detail pages.
- `clickCount` — incremented by `POST /api/listings/[id]/click` (same cookie pattern). `ClickTracker` fires this on card click in browse and all other listing card surfaces (see ClickTracker entry above).

### Saved Searches

`SavedSearch` model stores `userId`, `query`, `category`, `minPrice`, `maxPrice`, `tags[]`. API: `POST/GET/DELETE /api/search/saved`. Dashboard (`/dashboard`) shows a "Saved Searches" section with browse link and delete button per entry.

## SEO (complete)

- **`metadataBase`** set to `https://thegrainline.com` in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- **Root metadata** (`layout.tsx`): full title template (`%s | Grainline`), description, keywords, OG (type, siteName, title, description, `/og-image.jpg` 1200×630), Twitter card
- **`generateMetadata`** on `listing/[id]`, `seller/[id]`, and `browse` pages — title, description, OG image, Twitter card; listing page also sets `other: { product:price:amount, product:price:currency }`
- **Canonical URLs** — `alternates: { canonical }` on listing, seller, and browse `generateMetadata` (browse varies by `q` / `category` / default)
- **JSON-LD** on listing pages: `Product` schema (name, description, images, sku, brand, offers with seller name, aggregateRating when reviews exist) + `BreadcrumbList` (Home → Category → Listing, or Home → Listing if no category)
- **LocalBusiness JSON-LD** on seller pages: name, description, url, `knowsAbout: "Handmade Woodworking"`, PostalAddress (city/state), GeoCoordinates (only when lat/lng set)
- **Sitemap** (`src/app/sitemap.ts`): homepage `priority: 1.0` daily, browse `0.9` daily, active listings `0.8` weekly with `updatedAt`, seller profiles `0.6` monthly with `updatedAt`; private routes excluded
- **robots.txt** (`src/app/robots.txt/route.ts`): allows all crawlers with `Crawl-delay: 10`; disallows `/dashboard`, `/admin`, `/cart`, `/checkout`, `/api`; blocks AI training bots (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, CCBot, Google-Extended, anthropic-ai, MJ12bot, SemrushBot); rate-limits AhrefsBot (`Crawl-delay: 60`); `Sitemap: https://thegrainline.com/sitemap.xml`
- **Photo filename tip** in new and edit listing forms (below uploader/photos section)

## Seller Profile Personalization (complete)

### Schema additions
- **24 new `SellerProfile` fields**: `tagline`, `bannerImageUrl`, `workshopImageUrl`, `storyTitle`, `storyBody`, `instagramUrl`, `facebookUrl`, `pinterestUrl`, `tiktokUrl`, `websiteUrl`, `yearsInBusiness`, `acceptsCustomOrders`, `acceptingNewOrders`, `customOrderTurnaroundDays`, `offersGiftWrapping`, `giftWrappingPriceCents`, `returnPolicy`, `customOrderPolicy`, `shippingPolicy`, `featuredListingIds`, `galleryImageUrls`, `isVerifiedMaker`, `verifiedAt`
- **`SellerFaq` model** — `id`, `sellerProfileId`, `question`, `answer`, `sortOrder`, `createdAt`; `@@index([sellerProfileId, sortOrder])`; back-relation `faqs SellerFaq[]` on `SellerProfile`
- **`Order` fields**: `giftNote String?`, `giftWrapping Boolean @default(false)`
- Migration: `20260327190830_expand_seller_profile`

### UploadThing endpoints added
- `bannerImage` — 1 file, max 4MB, auth required

- `generateMetadata` uses `tagline` as fallback description; OG image prefers `bannerImageUrl` then `avatarImageUrl`

## Seller Avatar System (complete)

- **`SellerProfile.avatarImageUrl String?`** — custom uploaded avatar separate from Clerk `imageUrl`; migration `20260327193147_add_seller_avatar`
- **`ProfileAvatarUploader`** — client component using `galleryImage` endpoint; shows preview circle or placeholder; hidden input passes URL to form
- Avatar source priority everywhere: `seller.avatarImageUrl ?? seller.user?.imageUrl` — applied consistently in:
  - `/seller/[id]/page.tsx` (large banner-overlap avatar)
  - `src/app/browse/page.tsx` (seller chip on listing cards)
  - `src/app/listing/[id]/page.tsx` (seller chip on listing detail)
  - `src/app/page.tsx` (homepage most-saved and fresh-finds seller chips)
  - `src/app/dashboard/saved/page.tsx` (saved items seller chips)
- **Audited all avatar rendering sites** (2026-04-13): all seller-context avatars confirmed to use `avatarImageUrl ?? user.imageUrl` priority; buyer-only contexts (`User.imageUrl` alone) confirmed correct
- **Shop profile fallback preview** (`/dashboard/profile`): below `ProfileAvatarUploader`, shows the Clerk avatar (`user.imageUrl`) labeled "Current photo from Manage Account — used as fallback if no custom photo is uploaded above.". Query updated to `include: { user: { select: { imageUrl: true } } }`
- **Remove custom avatar** (2026-04-13): `removeSellerAvatar()` server action in `/dashboard/profile/page.tsx` sets `avatarImageUrl: null` and calls `revalidatePath`; "Remove custom photo" button shown as a ConfirmButton form only when `fullSeller.avatarImageUrl` is non-null; `ProfileAvatarUploader` has `key={fullSeller.avatarImageUrl ?? "none"}` to force remount on removal

## Gift Notes & Gift Wrapping at Checkout (complete)

- **Schema**: `Order.giftNote String?`, `Order.giftWrapping Boolean @default(false)`, `Order.giftWrappingPriceCents Int?`; migrations `20260327190830_expand_seller_profile`, `20260327200559_add_gift_wrapping_price`
- **`GiftNoteSection`** — controlled client component; "This is a gift" checkbox reveals gift note textarea (max 200 chars) and optional gift wrapping checkbox (shows seller's price if set); `onChange(note, wrapping)` callback
- **Cart page** — per-seller `giftBySeller` state; passes `giftNote`, `giftWrapping`, `giftWrappingPriceCents` in checkout request body
- **Checkout routes** (`checkout-seller`, `checkout/single`) — if `giftWrapping && giftWrappingPriceCents > 0`, appends "Gift Wrapping" Stripe line item; all three values passed through session metadata
- **Stripe webhook** — reads gift fields from metadata; saves to Order on create
- **Order detail pages** — amber "🎁 Gift order" box shown to both buyer (`/dashboard/orders/[id]`) and seller (`/dashboard/sales/[orderId]`) when `giftNote` or `giftWrapping` is set

## Notify When Back In Stock (complete)

- **`StockNotification` model** — `id`, `listingId`, `userId`, `createdAt`; `@@unique([listingId, userId])`; back-relations on `Listing` and `User`; migration `20260327194638_add_gift_and_stock_notification`
- **`POST /api/listings/[id]/notify`** — auth required; upserts `StockNotification` record; returns `{ subscribed: true }`
- **`DELETE /api/listings/[id]/notify`** — auth required; deletes record; returns `{ subscribed: false }`
- **`NotifyMeButton`** — client component; shown on listing detail when `isOutOfStock && !isOwnListing`; toggles subscription; redirects to sign-in if not logged in; shows "🔔 You'll be notified…" + unsubscribe link when subscribed
- Restock email (`sendBackInStock`) wired in `PATCH /api/listings/[id]/stock/route.ts` — sends to each subscriber when status transitions `SOLD_OUT → ACTIVE`; only fires once Resend domain is verified

## Homepage Personality Upgrades (complete)

`src/app/page.tsx` fully redesigned with 9 sections in order:

1. **Hero** — `min-h-screen` `bg-gradient-to-br from-amber-50 to-stone-100`; large heading; trending tag chips (raw SQL `unnest(tags)` top 5); centered `SearchBar`; "Browse the Workshop" + "Find Makers Near You" CTAs; bouncing chevron scroll indicator (`animate-bounce`, `absolute bottom-8`)
2. **Stats bar** — thin `border-b` strip; makers count fixed to `prisma.sellerProfile.count({ where: { listings: { some: { status: ACTIVE } } } })` (only active-listing sellers); "X pieces listed · X active makers · X orders fulfilled"; wrapped in `ScrollSection` for fade-in
3. **Find Makers Near You** — full-width `bg-stone-50 border-b` section; heading + subheading; `MakersMapSection` (now accepts optional `heading`/`subheading` props, falls back to defaults); replaces old "Made Near You" at bottom
4. **Shop by Category** — 5 categories + "Browse all →" tile; `overflow-x-auto` horizontal scroll on mobile, `grid-cols-6` on desktop; `ScrollSection` fade-in
5. **Meet a Maker spotlight** — 3-tier selection: (1) admin-featured (`featuredUntil > now()`) takes priority, (2) weekly deterministic rotation among all Guild Members/Masters aligned to Monday–Sunday calendar weeks (same anchor used for "Maker of the Week" pill), (3) most-reviewed seller fallback. Two-column desktop layout (`lg:grid-cols-2`) — left: amber "Maker of the Week" pill, avatar, GuildBadge, tagline, location, rating, bio (120 chars), "Visit Their Workshop" button; right: 3-column grid of up to 3 featured listing cards (curated `featuredListingIds[]` first, then most recent ACTIVE). Banner `h-48`. Right column hidden if no active listings. `ScrollSection` fade-in
6. **Fresh from the Workshop 🪵** — horizontal scroll row (`overflow-x-auto flex snap-x snap-mandatory`), 6 cards, `w-56 flex-none` per card; `ScrollSection` fade-in
7. **Collector Favorites ❤️** — same horizontal scroll pattern, 6 cards; `ScrollSection` fade-in
8. **Stories from the Workshop** — 3-col grid of blog post cards; `ScrollSection` fade-in
9. **Newsletter signup** — full-width `bg-amber-50 border-t` section; uses `NewsletterSignup` component; `ScrollSection` fade-in

`RecentlyViewed` removed from homepage (still present on `/browse`).

## Tone & Copy (complete)

- **Sellers → Makers** in all user-facing UI text (map subtitle, listing "Message maker", order pages, pickup coordination text — variable/API/URL names unchanged)
- **Order status personality banners** — neutral card shown at top of both buyer (`/dashboard/orders/[id]`) and seller (`/dashboard/sales/[orderId]`) order detail pages:
  - Buyer: "Your maker is preparing your piece" / "Your piece is on its way! 🚚" / "Delivered — enjoy your piece! 🎉" / "Ready for pickup!" / "Picked up — enjoy!"
  - Seller: "New order — time to get crafting! 🪵" / "Shipped — nice work!" / "Delivered — another happy collector!" / "Ready for pickup!" / "Picked up — great work!"
- **Empty states with personality** across: browse ("No pieces found…"), dashboard listings ("Your workshop is empty — list your first piece and start selling"), buyer orders ("No orders yet — find something you love in the browse page"), sales ("No orders yet — your first sale is right around the corner 🪵"), saved items ("Nothing saved yet — start hearting pieces you love while browsing"), messages ("No conversations yet — reach out to a maker about their work"), reviews ("No reviews yet — be the first to share your experience")
- **Custom 404** (`src/app/not-found.tsx`) — "Looks like this page got sanded down." with "Browse the Workshop" + "Go Home" buttons
- **Custom error** (`src/app/error.tsx`) — `"use client"`, "Something splintered." with "Try again" (calls `reset`) + "Go Home" buttons
- **`acceptingNewOrders` indicator** — amber pill "Not accepting new orders" / "Maker currently not accepting new orders" shown on browse cards (grid + list) and listing detail page when `seller.acceptingNewOrders === false`

## Custom Order System (complete)

### Schema additions
- **`Listing`**: `isPrivate Boolean @default(false)`, `reservedForUserId String?` (→ `User @relation("ReservedListings")`), `customOrderConversationId String?`
- **`Message`**: `kind String?` — structured message type; values: `custom_order_request`, `custom_order_link`
- **`User`**: `reservedListings Listing[] @relation("ReservedListings")` back-relation
- Migration: `20260327204512_add_custom_order_system`

### Entry points (three places to request a custom order)
1. **Seller profile** (`/seller/[id]`) — "🔨 Request a Custom Piece" amber button shown when `seller.acceptsCustomOrders && meId && meId !== seller.userId`; sign-in link if logged out
2. **Listing detail** (`/listing/[id]`) — "Request Something Similar" panel below buy buttons when `seller.acceptsCustomOrders && !isOwnListing && !reservedForOther`; sign-in link if logged out
3. **Message thread** — `custom_order_request` card has "Create Custom Listing →" button for the seller (shown when `m.senderId !== meId`)

### `CustomOrderRequestForm` (`src/components/CustomOrderRequestForm.tsx`)
Self-contained `"use client"` component with trigger button + modal overlay:
- **Fields**: description (required, max 500), dimensions (optional), budget in USD (optional), timeline select (no rush / 2 months / 1 month / 2 weeks)
- **On submit**: `POST /api/messages/custom-order-request` → success state with "View Conversation" button that navigates to `/messages/[conversationId]`
- Accepts `triggerLabel` and `triggerClassName` props so server components can import and render it directly

### `POST /api/messages/custom-order-request`
- Auth required; validates `sellerUserId` and `description`
- Upserts conversation (same canonical sort + race-safe logic as `/messages/new`)
- Creates `Message` with `kind: "custom_order_request"`, `body`: JSON with `description`, `dimensions`, `budget`, `timeline`, `timelineLabel`, `listingId`, `listingTitle`
- Returns `{ conversationId }`

### Custom listing creation (`/dashboard/listings/custom`)
URL: `/dashboard/listings/custom?conversationId=[id]&buyerId=[id]`
- Seller-only page (uses `ensureSeller()`)
- Shows buyer's `custom_order_request` details at top (amber reference card)
- Form mirrors new listing form; hidden fields: `conversationId`, `reservedForUserId`
- `createCustomListing` server action: creates listing with `isPrivate: true`, `reservedForUserId`, `customOrderConversationId`; sends `custom_order_link` message back (JSON body: `listingId`, `title`, `priceCents`, `currency`); redirects to `/messages/[conversationId]`

### ThreadMessages rendering (`src/components/ThreadMessages.tsx`)
- `Msg` type gains `kind?: string | null`
- `custom_order_request` → amber card with description, dimensions, budget, timeline; seller sees "Create Custom Listing →" link
- `custom_order_link` → white card with listing title, price, "Purchase This Piece →" link to `/listing/[id]`
- `kind` added to all message selects: server page, `/api/messages/[id]/list`, `/api/messages/[id]/stream`

### Private listing enforcement
- Browse, homepage, search suggestions, tag counts all add `isPrivate: false` to Prisma queries and raw SQL (`AND "isPrivate" = false`)
- Listing detail page: `reservedForOther` hides buy buttons and shows "custom piece reserved for another buyer" notice; `reservedForMe` shows "🎨 This piece was made just for you!" amber banner and buy buttons display normally
- `/api/listings/[id]/stock` PATCH: private listings are not promoted to `ACTIVE` when restocked

## Guild Verification Program (Phases 1, 2, 3 complete)

Two-tier badge system replacing the old single "Verified Maker" badge.

### Schema additions
- **`GuildLevel` enum** — `NONE | GUILD_MEMBER | GUILD_MASTER`
- **`VerificationStatus` additions** — `GUILD_MASTER_PENDING | GUILD_MASTER_APPROVED | GUILD_MASTER_REJECTED` (keeping existing `PENDING | APPROVED | REJECTED` for Guild Member)
- **`SellerProfile` additions**: `guildLevel GuildLevel @default(NONE)`, `guildMemberApprovedAt DateTime?`, `guildMasterApprovedAt DateTime?`, `guildMasterAppliedAt DateTime?`, `guildMasterReviewNotes String?`
- Migration: `20260330181203_add_guild_levels`
- `isVerifiedMaker` boolean retained on SellerProfile for legacy compatibility; set to `true` on Guild Member approval

### `GuildBadge` component (`src/components/GuildBadge.tsx`)
- `"use client"` — accepts `level: GuildLevelValue`, `showLabel?: boolean` (default `false`), `size?: number` (default `18`)
- Returns `null` if level is `"NONE"`
- `WREATH_D` (full single path from `gold-laurel-wreath.svg`, viewBox 1200x1200), `BADGE_VIEWBOX`, `STAR_POINTS` (5-point polygon, r_out=235, r_in=94, center 600,595 — slightly oversized to fully cover baked-in star) — module-level constants shared by both icons. Star rendered with `strokeWidth={30} strokeLinejoin="round"` for rounded points. No subpath splitting. `useId()` for hydration-safe gradient IDs.
- **Guild Member** — `LaurelWreathIcon`: earthy green wreath (`#5B7553 → #3F5D3A → #1F3A1E`, pine/oak tones) + bronze star polygon overlay (`#E8B86D → #B8860B → #8B6914`). Label text color `#14532d` (green-900).
- **Guild Master** — `StarWreathIcon` (replaces `HammerChiselIcon`): gold wreath (`#FFD700 → #D4AF37 → #B8960C`) + diamond star polygon overlay — cut-gemstone palette (`#FAFBFF → #D8DCE8 → #A0A8BC`). Both polygons same position/size, different gradients. Label text color `#B8960C`.
- Popup descriptions: original legally-reviewed language (profile standing disclaimer for Member; historical performance disclaimer for Master). Popup icon size 48px.
- **Popup**: `createPortal`-based — renders at `document.body` to avoid `overflow:hidden` clipping; positioned below the badge button using `getBoundingClientRect()` + scroll offsets, clamped to viewport width; closes on outside click or Escape; "Learn more about Guild Verification →" link to `/terms#guild-verification-program`. Opacity gating: popup starts at `opacity:0`, transitions to `opacity:1` after position calculated via `getBoundingClientRect` — eliminates top-left flash on open.
- `showLabel={false}` → icon only (used on listing cards); `showLabel={true}` → icon + label text (used on profile/detail pages)
- `GuildLevelValue` type exported from the file

### Badge placement with props

Status badges (Made to order / Ready to ship / Out of stock) removed from listing cards — redundant noise. Only visible on listing detail page. Guild badge: 40px, right-aligned in metadata area via two-column flex layout (`flex-1 min-w-0` for text, `flex-none` for badge), vertically centered against metadata block. No photo overlay. FavoriteButton heart wrapped in `bg-black/30 rounded-full p-1.5 backdrop-blur-sm` for visibility on all photo backgrounds. SimilarItems no longer shows a badge (too cluttered). Browse list-view ListCard keeps an inline 22px badge next to seller name.

LaurelWreathIcon and HammerChiselIcon default sizes both bumped to 32.

| Surface | `showLabel` | `size` |
|---|---|---|
| ListingCard metadata right column | `false` | `40` |
| Browse ListCard inline (list view only) | `false` | `22` |
| Commission interested makers | `false` | `22` |
| Makers metro directory | `false` | `22` |
| Listing detail seller section | `true` | `32` |
| Homepage Meet a Maker | `true` | `32` |
| Seller profile header | `true` | `36` |
| Seller shop header | `true` | `36` |
| Dashboard verification page (section headers) | `true` | `28` |

### Seller dashboard (`/dashboard/verification`)
Two sections:
- **Section A (Guild Member)**: Active (green) if `guildLevel !== NONE`; Under Review (amber) if `status === PENDING`; **eligibility checklist** otherwise showing ✓/✗ for each requirement (active listings ≥ 5, completed sales ≥ $250, account age ≥ 30 days, no cases open > 60 days) + profile completeness as ○ recommendation; application form shown only when all 4 criteria met
- **Section B (Guild Master)**: Only shown if `isMemberActive`; Active (indigo) if `guildLevel === GUILD_MASTER`; Under Review if `status === GUILD_MASTER_PENDING`; application form otherwise (business description, portfolio, standards checkbox)
- `applyForGuildMaster` server action updates `MakerVerification.status = GUILD_MASTER_PENDING` and `SellerProfile.guildMasterAppliedAt` in a `$transaction`

### Admin queue (`/admin/verification`)
Four sections:
1. **Guild Member Applications** (PENDING) — visual 8-item review checklist (profile photo, bio, listings, policies, no red flags, craft description authenticity, portfolio check, sales requirement); functional **admin override checkbox** ("Override $250 sales requirement"); `approveGuildMember(formData)` reads `verificationId` + `adminOverride` from form; when override checked, sets `reviewNotes = "Admin override: $250 sales requirement waived"` on approval; Reject with notes
2. **Guild Master Applications** (GUILD_MASTER_PENDING) — Approve (sets `guildLevel = GUILD_MASTER`, `guildMasterApprovedAt`) / Reject (sets `guildMasterReviewNotes`)
3. **Active Guild Members** — Revoke Badge (sets `guildLevel = NONE`, `isVerifiedMaker = false`)
4. **Active Guild Masters** — Revoke Guild Master (sets `guildLevel = GUILD_MEMBER`)
- All approve/reject send `VERIFICATION_APPROVED` / `VERIFICATION_REJECTED` notifications and emails

### API route (`/api/verification/apply`)
Server-side eligibility enforcement mirrors dashboard check — returns 400 with specific error messages if any of the 4 criteria fail (e.g. "You need $X more in sales").

### Terms page Section 19.2
Updated to remove "identity verification" language; now lists: completed profile, ≥5 active listings, $250 in completed sales, good account standing, reviewed by Grainline staff.

### Dashboard nav (`/dashboard`)
- `guildLevel === GUILD_MASTER` → indigo "Guild Master" pill
- `guildLevel === GUILD_MEMBER` → amber "Guild Member" pill
- `status === PENDING` → "Guild Badge Pending"
- Otherwise → "Apply for Guild Badge"

### Build fix
`package.json` build script updated to `"prisma generate && next build"` so Vercel always regenerates the Prisma client before compiling TypeScript.

### Phase 1 — complete (badge icon images still pending)
- Badge icons are functional SVGs (laurel wreath for Guild Member, hammer+chisel for Guild Master) — user may provide custom image replacements later
- Monogram stamp picker not yet built (see "Still unbuilt" under Phase 3)

### Phase 2 — complete

Migration: `20260330195257_seller_metrics_and_first_response`

- **`shippedAt DateTime?`** on `Order` — was already present from fulfillment work; set in both label route and fulfillment route when order ships
- **`firstResponseAt DateTime?`** on `Conversation` — set in `sendMessage` server action (`messages/[id]/page.tsx`) when the first reply is sent in a conversation where the other person sent the opening message
- **`SellerMetrics` model** — `id`, `sellerProfileId` (unique → SellerProfile cascade), `calculatedAt`, `periodMonths @default(3)`, `averageRating`, `reviewCount`, `onTimeShippingRate`, `responseRate`, `totalSalesCents`, `completedOrderCount`, `activeCaseCount`, `accountAgeDays`; back-relation `sellerMetrics SellerMetrics?` on `SellerProfile`
- **`calculateSellerMetrics(sellerProfileId, periodMonths=3)`** in `src/lib/metrics.ts` — computes all 9 metrics in parallel Prisma queries, upserts to `SellerMetrics`; also exports `meetsGuildMasterRequirements(metrics)` returning per-criteria booleans + `allMet`, and `GUILD_MASTER_REQUIREMENTS` constants
- **Guild Master requirements**: averageRating ≥ 4.5, reviewCount ≥ 25, onTimeShippingRate ≥ 95%, responseRate ≥ 90%, accountAgeDays ≥ 180, totalSalesCents ≥ $1,000, activeCaseCount = 0
- **Dashboard verification** (`/dashboard/verification`) — Section B now calls `calculateSellerMetrics()` on load when seller is Guild Member and hasn't been approved yet; shows live metrics vs requirements checklist (✓/✗ per criterion); application form only rendered when `masterCriteria.allMet === true`; falls back to static requirements list if metrics unavailable
- **Admin verification** (`/admin/verification`) — Guild Master Applications section fetches live metrics for each pending applicant via `Promise.allSettled`; each card shows an indigo "Live Metrics" panel with 8 metrics (avg rating, reviews, on-time shipping, response rate, account age, total sales, open cases, orders) with ✓/✗ indicators and "All requirements met" / "Some requirements not met" header badge

### Phase 3 — complete

Migration: `20260330201226_guild_phase3_revoke_tracking`

**Schema additions** on `SellerProfile`: `consecutiveMetricFailures Int @default(0)`, `lastMetricCheckAt DateTime?`, `metricWarningSentAt DateTime?`, `listingsBelowThresholdSince DateTime?`

**`vercel.json`** — two crons registered:
- `GET /api/cron/guild-metrics` — `0 9 1 * *` (monthly, 1st at 9am UTC)
- `GET /api/cron/guild-member-check` — `0 8 * * *` (daily, 8am UTC)

Both routes protected by `Authorization: Bearer CRON_SECRET` header.

**`src/app/api/cron/guild-metrics/route.ts`** — monthly Guild Master revocation:
- Fetches all `GUILD_MEMBER` + `GUILD_MASTER` sellers
- Processes in batches of 10 via `Promise.all`
- Guild Master pass: resets `consecutiveMetricFailures = 0`, clears `metricWarningSentAt`
- Guild Master fail (1st time): increments `consecutiveMetricFailures = 1`, sets `metricWarningSentAt`, sends `VERIFICATION_REJECTED` notification + `sendGuildMasterWarningEmail` listing which criteria failed
- Guild Master fail (2nd consecutive): revokes to `GUILD_MEMBER`, resets counters, sends notification + `sendGuildMasterRevokedEmail`
- Guild Member sellers: just updates `lastMetricCheckAt` (revocation handled by daily cron)
- Returns `{ processed, warned, revokedMaster, errors[] }`

**`src/app/api/cron/guild-member-check/route.ts`** — daily Guild Member revocation:
- Two checks per seller: (1) case `OPEN | IN_DISCUSSION | PENDING_CLOSE` with `createdAt < 90 days ago`; (2) `listingsBelowThresholdSince < 30 days ago`
- On revocation: sets `guildLevel = NONE`, `isVerifiedMaker = false`, sends notification + `sendGuildMemberRevokedEmail` with reason
- Returns `{ revokedMember, errors[] }`

**`listingsBelowThresholdSince` tracking** — set/cleared in three places:
- `api/listings/[id]/stock/route.ts` — after quantity update (via `syncListingsThreshold` helper)
- `dashboard/page.tsx` `setStatus()` — after hide/unhide
- `dashboard/page.tsx` `deleteListing()` — after delete

**Email functions** added to `src/lib/email.ts`: `sendGuildMasterWarningEmail` (lists failed criteria), `sendGuildMasterRevokedEmail`, `sendGuildMemberRevokedEmail` (includes reason string)

**Dashboard verification** (`/dashboard/verification`) — Guild Master section now shows:
- Amber warning banner with 30-day deadline if `metricWarningSentAt` is set
- Last check date + "Next check: 1st of next month" info block (shown for both Guild Member and Guild Master)

**Remaining infrastructure step:** Add `CRON_SECRET` env var to Vercel (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`). Both cron routes return 401 without it.

**Guild system additions (complete — 2026-04-01):**
- **Reapplication after revocation** — `dashboard/verification/page.tsx`: sellers with `guildLevel === "NONE"` and no pending application see the eligibility checklist and form (upsert action handles both first-time and re-applications). Guild Master: added rejection notice when `isMasterRejected && !guildMasterReviewNotes`.
- **Admin reinstatement** — `admin/verification/page.tsx`: new `reinstateGuildMember` server action sets `guildLevel = "GUILD_MEMBER"`, `isVerifiedMaker = true`, logs `REINSTATE_GUILD_MEMBER` audit entry. New "Revoked Guild Members" section shows sellers with `guildMemberApprovedAt` set but `guildLevel = "NONE"`.
- **Admin feature maker** — `admin/verification/page.tsx`: `FeatureMakerButton` client component (`src/components/admin/FeatureMakerButton.tsx`) on Active Guild Member and Guild Master rows. `featureMaker` server action sets `featuredUntil = now + 7 days`, logs `FEATURE_MAKER` to AdminAuditLog, revalidates `/admin/verification` and `/`. `unfeatureMaker` clears `featuredUntil`, logs `UNFEATURE_MAKER`. `SellerProfile.featuredUntil DateTime?` — migration `20260414002700_add_seller_featured_until`.

**Still unbuilt (separate from Phases 1–3):**
- Monogram stamp picker (Phase 1 cosmetic): `guildStampStyle String?` on `SellerProfile`; 4 styles (serif/block/script/ornate); unique wax-seal stamp per Guild Master using shop initials + chosen style

## Similar Items (redesigned 2026-04-15)

- **`GET /api/listings/[id]/similar`** — weighted similarity scoring. Fetches up to 20 candidates via raw SQL, scores each with: tag overlap (3 pts/match), same category (5 pts), price proximity (0-3 pts, closer = more), title word overlap (2 pts/shared word). Returns up to 12 sorted by total score. Wide price range (10%-1000%) to fill section even with few listings. Returns full `ListingCardData` shape (id, title, priceCents, currency, status, listingType, stockQuantity, photoUrl, secondPhotoUrl, seller object).
- **`SimilarItems`** (`src/components/SimilarItems.tsx`) — `"use client"` component; fetches on mount; horizontal scroll row using `ScrollFadeRow` + `ListingCard` (same card style as browse/homepage). Skeleton loading shows 4 placeholder cards. Hides section entirely if 0 results.
- **Listing detail page** — `<SimilarItems listingId={id} />` in "You might also like" section

## Blog System (complete)

### Schema
- **`BlogPost`** — `slug` (unique), `title`, `body`, `excerpt?`, `coverImageUrl?`, `videoUrl?`, `authorId` → `User @relation("BlogPostsAuthored")`, `authorType BlogAuthorType` (`STAFF | MAKER`), `sellerProfileId?` → `SellerProfile` (for Maker posts), `type BlogPostType` (`STANDARD | MAKER_SPOTLIGHT | BEHIND_THE_BUILD | GIFT_GUIDE | WOOD_EDUCATION`), `status BlogPostStatus` (`DRAFT | PUBLISHED | ARCHIVED`), `featuredListingIds String[]`, `tags String[]`, `metaDescription?`, `readingTimeMinutes?`, `publishedAt?`; back-relation `comments BlogComment[]`
- **`BlogComment`** — `postId` → `BlogPost` (cascade), `authorId` → `User @relation("BlogCommentsAuthored")`, `body`, `approved Boolean @default(false)` (moderation required before appearing)
- **`NewsletterSubscriber`** — `email` (unique), `name?`, `subscribedAt`, `active Boolean`
- Back-relations: `User.blogPosts`, `User.blogComments`, `SellerProfile.blogPosts`; migration `20260327215946_add_blog_system`

### Utilities (`src/lib/blog.ts`)
- `generateSlug(title)` — lowercase, spaces→hyphens, strip special chars
- `calculateReadingTime(body)` — word count ÷ 200, minimum 1
- `BLOG_TYPE_LABELS` — human-readable labels per `BlogPostType`; `WOOD_EDUCATION` label is "Workshop Tips" (updated 2026-04-01)
- `BLOG_TYPE_COLORS` — Tailwind badge color classes per type

### APIs
- `POST /api/newsletter` — upserts `NewsletterSubscriber`, no auth required
- `GET /api/blog` — paginated published posts, filterable by `type` and `tag`
- `GET /api/blog/[slug]/comments` — approved comments only
- `GET /api/blog/[slug]/comments` — returns top-level comments (`parentId: null`) with their approved replies nested under `replies[]`
- `POST /api/blog/[slug]/comments` — auth required; creates comment with `approved: false`; accepts optional `parentId`; depth enforced server-side (level 4+ flattens to level 3 by attaching to parent's parent); sends `BLOG_COMMENT_REPLY` notification to effective parent author (if different from replier), or `NEW_BLOG_COMMENT` to post author for top-level comments

### `BlogComment` self-relation (migration `20260413191812_add_blog_comment_replies`)
- `parentId String?`, `parent BlogComment? @relation("CommentReplies", ...)`, `replies BlogComment[] @relation("CommentReplies")`; `@@index([parentId])`
- **3-level threading** (updated 2026-04-13): depth enforced server-side only — no additional migration needed. Level 1 (root) → Level 2 (reply) → Level 3 (reply to reply). Attempts to reply at level 4+ flatten to level 3 (POST attaches to the level-2 parent instead). GET returns root comments with 2 levels of nested approved replies via `replies: { include: { replies: { ... } } }`.
- **Avatar priority in comments** (2026-04-13): `AUTHOR_SELECT` const in `api/blog/[slug]/comments/route.ts` includes `sellerProfile: { select: { avatarImageUrl: true } }` at all 3 nesting levels; GET response mapped to add `avatarUrl = sellerProfile?.avatarImageUrl ?? imageUrl` per comment/reply/level-3-reply; `blog/[slug]/page.tsx` and `BlogReplyToggle.tsx` interfaces updated to include `sellerProfile?` on author and use `avatarUrl` for rendering

### Components
- **`NewsletterSignup`** — client component; email + optional name; success state "You're on the list! 🎉"; client-side email format validation
- **`BlogCopyLinkButton`** — Web Share API with clipboard copy fallback
- **`BlogCommentForm`** — `"use client"`; props: `slug`, `parentId?`, `onCancel?`, `placeholder?`; sends parentId in POST body when provided; success state shows "Close" button when `onCancel` provided; button label: "Post reply" vs "Post comment"
- **`BlogReplyToggle`** (`src/components/BlogReplyToggle.tsx`) — `"use client"`; renders level-2 replies indented with `pl-8 border-l border-neutral-100`; each level-2 reply has its own Reply button (separate `showingReplyId` state) and its level-3 replies at `pl-10 border-l border-neutral-100`; no Reply button on level-3 comments; root Reply button adds level-2 replies; hidden entirely if no replies and not signed in
- **`BlogPostForm`** — full create/edit form: title + slug preview, type select (staff: all types; makers: STANDARD + BEHIND_THE_BUILD only), cover image upload, video URL, **TipTap WYSIWYG body editor** (bold appears bold, headings appear as headings — replaced plain markdown textarea), excerpt (200 char counter), meta description (160 char counter), comma-separated tags, featured listing checkboxes, status select. Blog body stored as markdown (`tiptap-markdown` handles rich text ↔ markdown conversion). Dependencies: `@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`, `@tiptap/extension-link`, `@tiptap/extension-image`, `@tiptap/pm`, `tiptap-markdown`.
- **`MarkdownToolbar`** (`src/components/MarkdownToolbar.tsx`) — TipTap-based WYSIWYG editor with toolbar buttons: Bold, Italic, Strikethrough, H2, H3, Bullet list, Ordered list, Blockquote, Code block, Link, Image, Horizontal rule. Active state highlighting on toolbar buttons. Hidden `<input name="body">` contains markdown for formData submission. `key={defaultValues.body}` on the component forces TipTap re-initialization when editing a different post. CSS placeholder via `data-placeholder` attribute in globals.css.

### Public pages
- **`/blog`** — gradient hero, type filter tab strip, featured post (large card, first result page 1 only), 12-per-page grid with cover image/badge/excerpt/author/date, pagination, `NewsletterSignup` at bottom; `generateMetadata`. Blog listing page card avatars also resolve `author.sellerProfile.avatarImageUrl ?? author.imageUrl` (author select includes `sellerProfile: { select: { avatarImageUrl, displayName } }`).
- **`/blog/[slug]`** — `generateMetadata` (OG image from `coverImageUrl`); breadcrumb; type badge + reading time + date; author card (Maker links to seller profile); full-width cover image; YouTube/Vimeo iframe embed (extracts ID from URL); markdown body rendered via `marked`; social share (Twitter, Facebook, `BlogCopyLinkButton`); "Featured in this post" listing cards; `NewsletterSignup`; comment list (approved only) + `BlogCommentForm` for signed-in users; related posts (same type or overlapping tags)

### Dashboard
- **`/dashboard/blog`** — author's posts list with type/status badges, edit/delete/view actions
- **`/dashboard/blog/new`** — create form via `BlogPostForm`; `createBlogPost` server action generates unique slug (appends `-2`, `-3` etc. on collision), calculates reading time, sets `authorType` and `sellerProfileId`, sets `publishedAt` if PUBLISHED
- **`/dashboard/blog/[id]/edit`** — pre-filled `BlogPostForm`; `updateBlogPost` server action sets `publishedAt` on first publish transition, nulls it on unpublish

### Admin (`/admin/blog`)
- Pending comments queue at top with approve/delete actions; all posts list with author, status, pending comment count badge; Blog link in admin sidebar with unapproved comment count badge

### Integrations
- **Seller profile** (`/seller/[id]`) — "From the Workshop" section: up to 3 most recent published posts by this seller, shown as cards with cover image, type badge, title, excerpt, date
- **Homepage** (`/`) — "Stories from the Workshop" section: 3 most recent published posts, fetched in parallel with other homepage data; "Read more stories →" link to `/blog`
- **Sitemap** — `/blog` index at priority 0.8 daily; all published posts at priority 0.7 weekly with `updatedAt`
- **Header nav** — "Blog" link added to main nav

## Icon Library (complete)

`src/components/icons/index.tsx` — 64 named Feather-style outline SVG icon components (63 original + `Rss` added for Following/Feed nav). All icons accept `className?: string` and `size?: number` (default 20) props. Base SVG attrs: `viewBox="0 0 24 24"`, `fill="none"`, `stroke="currentColor"`, `strokeWidth={1.5}`, `strokeLinecap="round"`. **No emoji in structural/navigational UI. Category tiles use SVG icons at `size=28`. Section headings use `.font-display` serif text only — the `Logs` and `Heart` icons were removed from "Fresh from the Workshop" and "Buyer Favorites" headings for a cleaner appearance.**

**Exports** (grouped):
- Shopping/Commerce: `ShoppingBag`, `Tag`, `Gift`
- User/Account: `Heart`, `User`, `Store`

- **Feed**: `Rss`

**Used in:**
- `Header.tsx` — `MessageCircle` (signed-out messages link), `ShoppingBag` (cart), `Rss` (feed link)
- `seller/[id]/page.tsx` — `Instagram`, `Facebook`, `Pinterest`, `TikTok`, `Globe` replacing inline filled SVG paths
- `admin/layout.tsx` — `AlertTriangle` (Flagged Orders, Cases), `Package` (All Orders), `Shield` (Verification), `Edit` (Blog)
- `dashboard/page.tsx` — `Store` (Create listing), `User` (Shop Profile), `Package` (Shipping & Settings, My Orders), `Tag` (My Sales), `Grid` (Inventory), `MessageCircle` (Messages), `Edit` (My Blog), `Bell` (Notifications), `Sparkles` (Verified Maker badge), `BarChart` (Analytics)

## In-Site Notifications (complete)

### Schema
- **`NotificationType`** enum — 18 values (see enum section above)
- **`Notification`** model — `id`, `userId` → `User`, `type`, `title`, `body`, `link String?`, `read Boolean @default(false)`, `createdAt`; `@@index([userId, read])`

### Helper
`src/lib/notifications.ts` — `createNotification(userId, type, title, body, link?)` inserts a Notification row. All calls must be `await`ed (un-awaited calls may be killed before completion in serverless). Called in 19 places:
- Stripe webhook: `NEW_ORDER` (buyer + seller on order created, both cart and single/buy-now paths), `ORDER_SHIPPED` (buyer on manual mark-shipped), `LOW_STOCK` (seller when purchase drops IN_STOCK qty to 1 or 2 — both cart and single paths)
- Fulfillment API: `ORDER_DELIVERED` (buyer when seller marks delivered)
- Cases API: `CASE_OPENED` (seller), `CASE_MESSAGE` (other party), `CASE_RESOLVED` (buyer)
- Messages thread (`messages/[id]/page.tsx` `sendMessage` action): `NEW_MESSAGE` (recipient)
- Reviews API: `NEW_REVIEW` (seller)
- Custom order request API: `CUSTOM_ORDER_REQUEST` (seller)
- Custom listing creation: `CUSTOM_ORDER_LINK` (buyer)
- Stock restore/update (`api/listings/[id]/stock/route.ts`): `BACK_IN_STOCK` (subscribers via StockNotification), `LOW_STOCK` (seller when manually setting stock to 1 or 2)
- Maker verification approve/reject: `VERIFICATION_APPROVED` / `VERIFICATION_REJECTED` (seller)
- Favorites (`api/favorites/route.ts` POST): `NEW_FAVORITE` (listing owner) — **note**: `FavoriteButton` uses REST routes (`POST /api/favorites`, `DELETE /api/favorites/[listingId]`), not the `toggleFavorite` server action
- Blog comments API: `NEW_BLOG_COMMENT` (post author)

**Full audit completed 2026-03-28**: All 19 call sites confirmed using DB `User.id` (not Clerk session ID), all awaited, all links verified correct from recipient's perspective. 11 missing `await`s fixed across 9 files in earlier audit pass.

**Auto-mark-as-read**: `messages/[id]/page.tsx` server-side load marks any unread `NEW_MESSAGE` notifications whose `link` contains `/messages/[id]` as read, clearing the bell badge when the conversation is opened.

**Notification copy uses real names** (updated 2026-03-28): All notification titles/bodies use `name ?? email.split('@')[0] ?? 'Someone'` fallback chain. Fixed in 8 files: `api/favorites/route.ts`, `actions/toggleFavorite.ts`, `api/cases/route.ts` (CASE_OPENED), `api/cases/[id]/messages/route.ts` (CASE_MESSAGE), `api/messages/custom-order-request/route.ts` (CUSTOM_ORDER_REQUEST), `api/reviews/route.ts` (NEW_REVIEW), `api/blog/[slug]/comments/route.ts` (NEW_BLOG_COMMENT), `messages/[id]/page.tsx` (NEW_MESSAGE). Two files also had their `me` select expanded to include `name` and `email`: `custom-order-request` and `blog/[slug]/comments`.

**`ensureUser` P2002 fix** (2026-03-28): `src/lib/ensureUser.ts` now catches Prisma `P2002` unique constraint on email update and retries without the email field — fixes favorites (and any other `ensureUser` call) for accounts sharing an email with another DB row (e.g. admin accounts).

### API routes
- `GET /api/notifications` — auth required; returns up to 20 unread + 10 recent read notifications for the signed-in user
- `POST /api/notifications/mark-read` — auth required; body `{ ids?: string[] }` (omit to mark all read); updates `read = true`

### Components & pages
- **`NotificationBell`** (`src/components/NotificationBell.tsx`) — `"use client"`; polls `GET /api/notifications` every **5 minutes** (300000ms — was 30s; reduced 10x to cut Vercel CPU); shows `Bell` icon with red badge for unread count; dropdown list of recent notifications with title, body, timestamp, and link; "Mark all read" button; accepts `initialUnreadCount` prop (SSR hint). **Mobile positioning**: `fixed inset-x-4 top-14` on mobile (spans full width with 16px margins); `md:absolute md:right-0 md:top-8` on desktop
- **`/dashboard/notifications`** (`src/app/dashboard/notifications/page.tsx`) — full paginated notification history; "Mark all read" server action; grouped by read/unread; links to relevant pages
- **`UnreadBadge`** (`src/components/UnreadBadge.tsx`) — small red dot/count badge, reused by `NotificationBell`
- `NotificationBell` rendered in `Header.tsx` inside `<Show when="signed-in">`, replacing the static bell placeholder

## Recently Viewed (complete)

- **`src/lib/recentlyViewed.ts`** — client-side cookie utility (`rv` key, 30-day expiry, max 10 IDs, deduped); `getRecentlyViewed(): string[]` and `addRecentlyViewed(listingId: string): void` using `document.cookie` directly
- **`RecentlyViewedTracker`** (`src/components/RecentlyViewedTracker.tsx`) — `"use client"`, calls `addRecentlyViewed` on mount, renders `null`; added to `listing/[id]/page.tsx` alongside `ListingViewTracker`
- **`GET /api/listings/recently-viewed`** — accepts `?ids=id1,id2,...` (max 10), returns only ACTIVE non-private listings in requested order; fields: `id`, `title`, `priceCents`, `currency`, `photoUrl`, `sellerDisplayName`, `sellerAvatarImageUrl`
- **`RecentlyViewed`** (`src/components/RecentlyViewed.tsx`) — `"use client"`, reads cookie on mount, fetches API, horizontal scrollable row of up to 6 cards (photo, title, price, seller chip), animated skeleton loading, hides if empty
- Added to browse page (`/browse`) in `<Suspense>` below listings grid (removed from homepage in restructure)

## Request Custom Order in Thread (complete)

- **`ThreadCustomOrderButton`** (`src/components/ThreadCustomOrderButton.tsx`) — `"use client"` wrapper around `CustomOrderRequestForm` with amber pill styling (`🎨 Request Custom Order`)
- **`messages/[id]/page.tsx`** — fetches `otherSellerProfile` (`acceptsCustomOrders`) alongside conversation query; renders `ThreadCustomOrderButton` in the thread header next to the other participant's name when `otherSellerProfile.acceptsCustomOrders === true`

## Scroll Animations (complete)

- **`src/hooks/useInView.ts`** — `"use client"` hook using `IntersectionObserver` (threshold 0.08); fires once when element enters viewport then disconnects; returns `{ ref, inView }`
- **`src/components/ScrollSection.tsx`** — `"use client"` wrapper; applies `opacity-0 translate-y-6 → opacity-100 translate-y-0` with `transition-all duration-700 ease-out` on scroll; used for every homepage section below the hero

## Email System (complete)

`src/lib/email.ts` — 18 email functions with a sharp-edged HTML template (off-white `#FAFAF8` background, no `border-radius` anywhere, dark `#1C1C1A` header bar with Grainline wordmark, warm gray `#3D3D3A` body text, footer with unsubscribe link). `RESEND_API_KEY` guard: logs a warning and skips send if env var is missing — never crashes the app.

### Email functions

**Transactional:** `sendOrderConfirmedBuyer`, `sendOrderConfirmedSeller`, `sendOrderShipped`, `sendReadyForPickup`, `sendCaseOpened`, `sendCaseMessage`, `sendCaseResolved`, `sendCustomOrderRequest`, `sendCustomOrderReady`, `sendBackInStock`, `sendVerificationApproved`, `sendVerificationRejected`, `sendRefundIssued`

**Notification:** `sendNewMessageEmail` — fires on new message with 5-minute active-conversation throttle (skipped if recipient replied in last 5 mins); respects `EMAIL_NEW_MESSAGE` preference. `sendNewReviewEmail` — fires on new review with rating display; respects `EMAIL_NEW_REVIEW` preference.

**Lifecycle:** `sendWelcomeBuyer`, `sendWelcomeSeller`, `sendFirstListingCongrats`, `sendFirstSaleCongrats`

### Wiring (16 locations, all wrapped in `try/catch`)

| File | Email(s) |
|---|---|
| `api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` | `sendOrderConfirmedBuyer` (always); `sendOrderConfirmedSeller` (respects `EMAIL_NEW_ORDER`); `sendFirstSaleCongrats` (always, if count = 1) |
| `api/orders/[id]/fulfillment/route.ts` | `sendOrderShipped` (action=shipped), `sendReadyForPickup` (action=ready_for_pickup) — always |
| `api/cases/route.ts` | `sendCaseOpened` (respects `EMAIL_CASE_OPENED`) |
| `api/cases/[id]/messages/route.ts` | `sendCaseMessage` (respects `EMAIL_CASE_MESSAGE`) |
| `api/cases/[id]/resolve/route.ts` | `sendCaseResolved` (respects `EMAIL_CASE_RESOLVED`) |
| `api/messages/custom-order-request/route.ts` | `sendCustomOrderRequest` (respects `EMAIL_CUSTOM_ORDER`) |
| `dashboard/listings/custom/page.tsx` | `sendCustomOrderReady` (respects `EMAIL_CUSTOM_ORDER`) |
| `api/listings/[id]/stock/route.ts` | `sendBackInStock` per subscriber — always |
| `admin/verification/page.tsx` | `sendVerificationApproved` / `sendVerificationRejected` — always |
| `api/orders/[id]/refund/route.ts` | `sendRefundIssued` — always |
| `api/clerk/webhook/route.ts` | `sendWelcomeBuyer` (user.created) — always |
| `dashboard/listings/new/page.tsx` | `sendFirstListingCongrats` (always, if count=1); `sendNewListingFromFollowedMakerEmail` per follower (respects `EMAIL_FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_LISTING`) |
| `messages/[id]/page.tsx` | `sendNewMessageEmail` (respects `EMAIL_NEW_MESSAGE`, 5-min throttle) |
| `api/reviews/route.ts` | `sendNewReviewEmail` (respects `EMAIL_NEW_REVIEW`) |

**Emails are live once `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM` env vars are set and the sending domain is verified in Resend.**

### Email Notification Preferences (complete — 2026-04-01)

`shouldSendEmail(userId, prefKey)` in `src/lib/notifications.ts` — centralized preference check before all non-transactional email sends.
- **Default ON**: sends unless user sets `prefs[key] = false`
- **Default OFF** (`EMAIL_SELLER_BROADCAST`, `EMAIL_NEW_FOLLOWER`): only sends if `prefs[key] = true`

All non-transactional email sends wrapped with `shouldSendEmail`. Transactional emails (order confirmations, shipping, refunds, welcome, lifecycle, verification) are never gated.

## Clerk User Sync Webhook (complete)

`src/app/api/clerk/webhook/route.ts` — verifies svix signature, handles `user.created` and `user.updated` events, upserts `User` record via `ensureUserByClerkId`, sends `sendWelcomeBuyer` on `user.created`. Route added to public matcher in `src/middleware.ts`.

**`User.imageUrl` sync**: `imageUrl: image_url ?? null` is passed to `ensureUserByClerkId` before the event-type branch, so `User.imageUrl` stays in sync with Clerk's `image_url` for **both** `user.created` and `user.updated` events. No separate sync logic needed — this is already handled.

**Deployment steps still required:**
1. Add `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to Vercel environment variables
2. Clerk Dashboard → **Production** → Developers → Webhooks → Add Endpoint → `https://thegrainline.com/api/clerk/webhook` → events: `user.created`, `user.updated` → copy Signing Secret → paste as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## MobileFilterBar (complete — 2026-04-13)

**Problem**: Making the filter button `sticky` inside the browse page's flex container failed in iOS Safari because listing cards use `rounded-2xl overflow-hidden`, which creates new stacking contexts that render over `position: sticky` elements in the same container.

**Fix**: Extracted all mobile filter UI into a new `src/components/MobileFilterBar.tsx` component, positioned as a **sibling** of the listings flex container (not inside it), so listing card stacking contexts cannot interfere.

- `sticky top-0 z-30 bg-[#F7F5F0] border-b` — always visible at top of viewport on mobile
- Bottom sheet uses `createPortal(sheet, document.body)` to escape all ancestor stacking contexts
- `mounted` state guards `createPortal` against SSR/hydration mismatch
- Accepts `popularTags: string[]` prop; duplicates all form state from `FilterSidebar`
- `md:hidden` on the sticky bar; sheet also has `md:hidden` — desktop unaffected
- **Sort button** added next to Filter button — opens separate small sort-only sheet via `createPortal`; label shows current sort (e.g. "Sort: Newest"); options navigate to `/browse?sort=...` preserving all other params; sort still present inside main Filters sheet too
- **Sheet sizing reverted to max-h-[85vh] (main filters) and max-h-[50vh] (sort)** — sheets auto-size to content; short sheets look short, long sheets scroll. iOS safe-area inset for home indicator is correct behavior; no pb override needed.
- **Sticky wrapper uses `top-[2px]` + `pt-3`** to prevent button outline clip — pulls bar 2px below viewport top; buttons have `mt-[2px]` for additional inset
- **Header stacking context raised to `z-[50]`** (was `z-30`) — the `<header>` element itself creates a CSS stacking context; because the drawer backdrop and panel are children of that context, raising the header's z-index is the only way to make them paint above sticky elements (which are z-30 in the root context). Backdrop raised to `z-[1000]`, panel to `z-[1001]` within the header's stacking context.

**FilterSidebar changes**: Removed mobile button block, mobile sheet, `mobileOpen` state, Escape key effect, body scroll lock effect, and `activeFilterCount`. Desktop `<aside>` unchanged.

**Applied to**: `src/app/browse/page.tsx` — `<MobileFilterBar popularTags={popularTags} />` inserted before the flex container in both the main render and the no-results early return. Metro browse pages not applicable (no FilterSidebar).

## Mobile Audit Round 2 (complete)

Second mobile fix pass (2026-03-29). Zero TypeScript errors.

### FilterSidebar (`src/components/FilterSidebar.tsx`)
- **Apply button fixed** — removed `onClick={() => setMobileOpen(false)}` from the submit button; the premature state update was unmounting the form before the browser could process the `method="get"` submission. Sheet now closes via the existing `searchParams` useEffect when the URL updates after navigation.
- Reset link's `onClick` also removed for the same reason.

### Header (`src/components/Header.tsx`)
- **Logo tap target** — added `flex items-center min-h-[44px]` to the logo `<Link>` for a proper 44px touch target on mobile.
- **Messages drawer row fixed** — the "Messages" text span was not navigable (only the `MessageIconLink` icon was a link). Restructured: `MessageIconLink` (icon + unread badge) stays as the icon, a sibling `<Link href="/messages">` covers the text label. Both elements are now independently navigable.

### Notifications API (`src/app/api/notifications/route.ts`)
- **Auto-cleanup** — on `GET /api/notifications`, fire-and-forget `deleteMany` removes `read: true` notifications older than 90 days. **Runs only when `getMinutes() === 0`** (~1/60th of requests) — was running on every poll, a 60x unnecessary write load. Only read notifications are pruned; unread are never deleted.

### Dashboard listings (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- "My Listings" section: `flex overflow-x-auto snap-x snap-mandatory` on mobile → `sm:grid sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` on desktop. Each card gets `min-w-[220px] flex-none snap-start sm:min-w-0`.
- **Preview → link**: shown next to Edit for DRAFT, HIDDEN, and PENDING_REVIEW listings; links to `/listing/[id]?preview=1` in a new tab

### Seller profile (`src/app/seller/[id]/page.tsx`)
- **Featured Work**, **All Listings**, and **From the Workshop** (blog posts) sections all converted to the same pattern: horizontal scroll row on mobile (`flex overflow-x-auto snap-x snap-mandatory pb-4`), grid on tablet/desktop (`sm:grid` or `md:grid`). Min-width per card: 200–220px.

### Message interface
- **`src/components/MessageComposer.tsx`** — outer container changed to `sticky bottom-0 bg-white border-t` with `[padding-bottom:calc(0.75rem+env(safe-area-inset-bottom))]` for iPhone home-bar clearance. Send button: icon-only on mobile (paper-plane SVG), text label on `sm+`.
- **`src/components/ThreadMessages.tsx`** — message bubble max-width changed to `max-w-[85%] sm:max-w-[70%]`. Added `pb-4` to inner `<ul>`. **Scroll fix**: thread auto-scrolls to latest messages on load using direct `boxRef.current.scrollTop = scrollHeight` (not `scrollIntoView`, which scrolled the whole page). `requestAnimationFrame` wraps scroll calls to ensure DOM has settled. **Thread avatars**: other participant's 32px avatar shown to the left of their messages, bottom-aligned (`flex items-end gap-2`). Only the last consecutive message in a run from that person gets the avatar; earlier messages in the run get an invisible `w-8` spacer. System messages (`commission_interest_card`, `custom_order_request`, `custom_order_link`, `isSystemMessage: true`) never get an avatar.
- **`src/app/messages/[id]/page.tsx`** — reduced padding: `p-4 sm:p-8`, `space-y-4 sm:space-y-6`. **Thread header restructured into two rows for mobile**: Row 1 has `← Inbox` back link + participant avatar + name. Row 2 (indented, `flex-wrap`) has action buttons (Request Custom Order, Archive/Unarchive). Archive button changed from `rounded-full` to `rounded-md`. Listing reference card changed from `rounded-xl` to `rounded-lg`.
- **`src/app/messages/page.tsx`** — conversation list timestamp hidden on mobile (`hidden sm:block`).

## Mobile Audit (complete)

Full responsive audit and fix pass across all key pages (2026-03-29). Zero TypeScript errors.

### Header (`src/components/Header.tsx`)
- Mobile (< `md`): shows logo + cart icon + hamburger only
- Hamburger opens a right-slide drawer (`animate-slide-in-right`, `w-72 max-w-[85vw]`): search bar (home/browse only), Browse, Blog, Messages (with `MessageIconLink` unread badge), Notifications link (with count fetched in Header state), Cart with count, Dashboard, Admin (role-gated), `UserButton` at bottom
- Drawer closes on Escape, backdrop click, or navigation (`pathname`/`searchParams` effect)
- Body scroll locked while drawer open

### Filter Sidebar (`src/components/FilterSidebar.tsx`)
- Mobile: sidebar hidden; sticky "Filters (N)" button with `Filter` icon and active-filter count badge
- Clicking opens bottom sheet (`animate-slide-up`, `max-h-[85vh]`, drag handle, Apply/Close buttons)
- Active filter count computed from all current URL params
- Desktop: sidebar unchanged

### Browse page (`src/app/browse/page.tsx`)
- Both main and no-results layouts changed from `flex` row to `flex flex-col md:flex-row` so the filter button stacks above listings on mobile

### Admin panel (`src/app/admin/layout.tsx` + `src/components/AdminMobileNav.tsx`)
- Mobile: sidebar hidden; new `AdminMobileNav` client component renders a horizontal scrollable tab strip above content
- Tabs: Orders, Cases, Flagged, Verify, Blog — active tab highlighted via `usePathname`; amber badge dots for counts
- Layout changed to `flex-col md:flex-row`; content padding `p-4 md:p-8`

### Dashboard nav (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Button container: `grid grid-cols-2 sm:flex sm:flex-wrap`
- Each button: `flex-col sm:flex-row`, larger icon (20px) on mobile, smaller (16px) on desktop, `min-h-[56px]` on mobile for 44px+ tap targets

### Listing detail (`src/app/listing/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Price: bumped to `text-2xl font-semibold`
- Buy buttons: own row, `w-full` on mobile with `py-3 min-h-[44px]`, `sm:w-auto` on desktop
- Additional photo thumbnails: `flex overflow-x-auto snap-x snap-mandatory` on mobile → `sm:grid sm:grid-cols-4` on desktop

### globals.css (`src/app/globals.css`)
- `text-size-adjust: 100%; font-size: max(16px, 1em)` on all `input`, `textarea`, `select` — prevents iOS auto-zoom on focus
- `@keyframes slide-in-right` → `.animate-slide-in-right` for header drawer
- `@keyframes slide-up` → `.animate-slide-up` for filter bottom sheet

## Listing Card Design (complete)

All listing cards share a consistent sharp-edged design:
- **No rounded corners** — `rounded-xl` / `rounded-lg` removed from card containers and list-view thumbnails
- **Light gray border** — `border border-neutral-200` (not plain `border` which renders as black/dark in some Tailwind configs)
- **Warm gray info section** — title/price/seller row has `bg-stone-50` background to visually separate from the photo

Applied in:
- `src/app/browse/page.tsx` — `GridCard` (container + info/seller divs), `ListCard` (container + thumbnail), no-results featured items
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Fresh from the Workshop + Buyer Favorites horizontal scroll cards; blog post cards
- `src/components/SimilarItems.tsx` — card list items + skeleton placeholders

## FavoriteButton Coverage (complete)

`FavoriteButton` is present on every listing card surface. Sign-out is handled: clicking while unauthenticated receives a 401 and redirects to `/sign-in?redirect_url=<current-path>`.

| Surface | File | `initialSaved` source |
|---|---|---|
| Browse grid + list | `src/app/browse/page.tsx` | `savedSet` (server query) |
| Homepage Fresh / Buyer Favorites | `src/app/page.tsx` | `saved` Set (server query) |
| Seller profile — Featured Work | `src/app/seller/[id]/page.tsx` | `savedSet` (server query via `meId`) |
| Seller profile — All Listings | `src/app/seller/[id]/page.tsx` | `savedSet` (server query via `meId`) |
| Similar Items | `src/components/SimilarItems.tsx` | `false` (client component, no server query) |

Card containers use `<div className="relative">` wrapping the photo Link; `FavoriteButton` sits outside the Link to avoid nested-interactive-element violation. The button's own `absolute right-3 top-3 z-10` handles positioning.

## Seller Shop Page (complete)

`/seller/[id]/shop` — dedicated paginated listing grid for a seller's shop. Deployed 2026-03-29.

- **Files**: `src/app/seller/[id]/shop/page.tsx` (server component), `src/app/seller/[id]/shop/SortSelect.tsx` ("use client" dropdown)
- **URL params**: `?category=` (filter by Category enum), `?sort=newest|price_asc|price_desc|popular`, `?page=` (1-based, 20/page)
- **Category tabs** — "All" + one pill per category the seller actually has ACTIVE listings in (via `groupBy`); active tab is filled `bg-neutral-900 text-white`; horizontal scroll on mobile
- **Sort dropdown** (`SortSelect.tsx`) — client component; on change, pushes new URL preserving current category; options: Newest / Price: Low to High / Price: High to Low / Most Popular
- **Grid** — `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4`; cards: `border border-neutral-200`, `bg-stone-50` info section, `FavoriteButton` with `savedSet` server query
- **Pagination** — Prev / `Page X of Y` / Next links; only shown when `totalPages > 1`
- **Empty state** — category-aware message when no listings match
- **Header bar** — seller avatar + name + "← Back to profile" link + Verified Maker badge
- **`generateMetadata`** — canonical URL, title, description
- **Entry points**:
  - `src/app/seller/[id]/page.tsx` All Listings section: shows first 8, "See all N pieces →" link in header; "See all N pieces →" button below when >8
  - `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` My Listings section: "View My Shop →" link next to heading
- **Sitemap** — seller profiles now use `flatMap` to emit both `/seller/[id]` and `/seller/[id]/shop` at priority 0.6 monthly
- **FavoriteButton** covered: `savedSet` server query for signed-in users; `initialSaved={false}` fallback for signed-out (401 → redirect)
- **Owner view** (2026-04-13): `isOwner = userId === seller.user.clerkId`; seller query includes `user: { select: { clerkId: true } }`. Owner sees ALL listings regardless of status + chargesEnabled; buyers see ACTIVE + chargesEnabled only (unchanged). Category tabs for owner show categories from all statuses. Each owner-view card shows a status badge below (Draft=gray, Hidden=gray, Under Review=amber, Sold=neutral, Sold Out=neutral) and an "Edit →" link to `/dashboard/listings/[id]/edit`.
- **Owner status filter tabs** (2026-04-13): second row of smaller tabs below category tabs, shown to owner only; tabs: All / Active / Draft / Hidden / Sold Out / Sold / Under Review; `?status=` URL param; status AND'd with category in where clause; category groupBy also filtered by status; empty states have "Create listing →" and "View all listings" links per status
- **`ShopListingActions`** (`src/app/seller/[id]/shop/ShopListingActions.tsx`) — `"use client"` with `useTransition` + inline toast; Publish (DRAFT/HIDDEN → `publishListingAction`, toasts "Published!" or "Sent for review."), Hide (ACTIVE → HIDDEN), Unhide (HIDDEN → ACTIVE, notifies followers; blocked for REJECTED), Resubmit for Review (REJECTED → `publishListingAction`), Mark sold (ACTIVE → SOLD), Delete (all except PENDING_REVIEW), Edit link always present
- **`src/app/seller/[id]/shop/actions.ts`** — server actions: `hideListingAction`, `unhideListingAction`, `markSoldAction`, `markAvailableAction`, `deleteListingAction`, `publishListingAction`; all verify ownership via `getOwnedListing`; `syncThreshold` mirrors dashboard Guild Member tracking; `publishListingAction` runs `reviewListingWithAI` + `logAdminAction` identically to new listing creation flow; returns `{ status: "ACTIVE" | "PENDING_REVIEW" } | { error: string }` — returns `{ error }` instead of throwing on chargesEnabled failure because Next.js server actions mask thrown error messages in production. Client checks `"error" in result` before checking `result.status`.

## Security Audit (complete — 2026-03-30)

Full audit of all 51 API routes. 49/51 already secure; 2 vulnerabilities fixed and deployed.

### Fixes applied

**`/api/shipping/quote` (POST)** — Added `auth()` + cart ownership verification
- Previously: no authentication required; cart looked up by opaque UUID with no ownership check
- Fix: `auth()` returns 401 for unauthenticated callers; in cart mode, added `if (cart.userId !== me.id) return 403`
- Risk mitigated: unauthenticated Shippo API abuse (cost), and theoretically reading another user's cart-linked data

**`/api/checkout` (POST)** — Added three missing guards on the legacy direct-checkout route
- `listing.status !== "ACTIVE"` → 400 (blocked buying drafts, sold, hidden listings)
- `listing.isPrivate && listing.reservedForUserId !== me.id` → 400 (private/reserved listings only for intended buyer)
- `listing.seller.userId === me.id` → 400 (blocked self-purchase, a Stripe ToS violation and fraud vector)
- Note: the main cart checkout routes (`/api/cart/checkout`, `/api/cart/checkout/single`) already had these checks

### Security posture

| Layer | Status |
|---|---|
| Authentication | ✅ Clerk on all sensitive routes; 401 before any data access |
| Authorization / ownership | ✅ All user-scoped mutations verify DB `userId` match; IDOR not possible |
| SQL injection | ✅ Prisma ORM — parameterized queries throughout; raw SQL only for analytics aggregations (read-only, no user input in table names) |
| Webhook integrity | ✅ Stripe HMAC signature verification; Clerk Svix signature verification |
| Role-based access | ✅ `EMPLOYEE | ADMIN` required for case resolution and admin panel; checked against DB role, not cookie |
| HTTPS | ✅ Enforced by Vercel / Cloudflare |
| Dev-only routes | ✅ `/api/dev/make-order` returns 403 in production (`NODE_ENV === "production"`) |
| File uploads | ✅ All UploadThing endpoints require auth via middleware (throws if no Clerk userId) |

### Remaining security improvements (not urgent)

- **Rate limiting** — ✅ Complete — `@upstash/ratelimit` with sliding window on 7 routes (see Rate Limiting section below)
- **Security headers** — Add `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` in `next.config.ts`
- **Input validation** — Add Zod schemas to validate and sanitize API request bodies (currently relies on manual type assertions and `.slice()` guards)

## Logo & Branding (complete)

- **`public/logo.svg`** — original designer SVG; cream fill `#F2E6D8`; kept unmodified as source
- **`public/logo-espresso.svg`** — production logo with `fill="#2C1F1A"` (espresso) baked directly into the SVG path; no CSS filter needed. Created via `sed` from `logo.svg`. CSS filter approach abandoned — unreliable across browsers/contexts.
- **`public/logo-mark.svg`** — grain lines swoosh mark only (4 curved fanning paths, `fill="currentColor"`); for use in Guild Master wax seal badge and other compact branding contexts
- **Espresso brand color**: `#2C1F1A` — used on logos (`logo-espresso.svg`), hero primary CTA (`bg-[#2C1F1A]`), and hero secondary CTA border/text. Hover variant: `#3A2A24`. Applied only to brand moments (logos, hero CTAs); body text and UI elements remain neutral-900.
- **Header** (`src/components/Header.tsx`): desktop logo `h-8`, mobile logo `h-7`, hamburger drawer logo `h-7` — all use `src="/logo-espresso.svg"` with no filter
- **Footer** (`src/app/layout.tsx`): `h-5` logo using `logo-espresso.svg` with `opacity-40` Tailwind class
- **Hero CTAs** (`src/app/page.tsx`): primary "Browse the Workshop" — `bg-[#2C1F1A] hover:bg-[#3A2A24] text-white rounded-full`; secondary "Find Makers Near You" — `border-2 border-[#2C1F1A] bg-transparent text-[#2C1F1A] hover:bg-[#2C1F1A] hover:text-white rounded-full`

## Rate Limiting (complete)

`src/lib/ratelimit.ts` — Upstash Redis sliding-window rate limiters via `@upstash/ratelimit`. All limiters have `analytics: true` (viewable in Upstash console).

**Upstash database**: `major-toad-67912.upstash.io`
**Required env vars**: `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` (set in Vercel production + preview + development + `.env.local`)

| Route | Limiter | Key | Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/search/suggestions` | `searchRatelimit` | IP | 30 / 10s |
| `POST /api/listings/[id]/view` | `viewRatelimit` | IP | 20 / 60s |
| `POST /api/listings/[id]/click` | `clickRatelimit` | IP | 20 / 60s |
| `POST /api/reviews` | `reviewRatelimit` | User ID | 5 / 60s |
| `POST /api/cart/checkout` | `checkoutRatelimit` | User ID | 10 / 60s |
| `POST /api/cart/checkout/single` | `checkoutRatelimit` | User ID | 10 / 60s |
| `GET /api/messages/[id]/stream` | `messageRatelimit` | User ID | 30 / 60s |

IP-keyed routes use `getIP(request)` (reads `x-forwarded-for`, falls back to `127.0.0.1`). User-keyed routes use Clerk `userId` directly. All return HTTP 429 on limit exceeded.

### Redis failover strategy

All `.limit()` calls are wrapped in one of two helpers from `src/lib/ratelimit.ts` — never the raw `.limit()` method directly:

- **`safeRateLimit(limiter, key)`** — **fail closed**: if Redis is unavailable, the request is rejected (returns `{ success: false }`). Used for all state-mutating routes where abuse has real cost: checkout, reviews, favorites, blog save, follow/unfollow, commission create/interest, broadcast, listing creation, messages stream.
- **`safeRateLimitOpen(limiter, key)`** — **fail open**: if Redis is unavailable, the request is allowed through. Used only for non-critical read-path analytics where a brief outage should not break the UX: view tracking (both global IP limiter and per-IP+listing dedup), click tracking, search suggestions.

## Seller Onboarding Flow (complete)

A 5-step guided wizard at `/dashboard/onboarding` that walks new makers through shop setup.

### Schema additions (migration `20260330222832_seller_onboarding`)
- **`SellerProfile.onboardingStep Int @default(0)`** — tracks the wizard step the seller is on (0–5)
- **`SellerProfile.onboardingComplete Boolean @default(false)`** — when `true`, the wizard is skipped; all existing sellers were backfilled to `true` in the migration

### Auto-redirect
`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` fetches `onboardingComplete` and `onboardingStep` alongside the `guildLevel` query. If `!onboardingComplete`, redirects to `/dashboard/onboarding` before rendering.

### Onboarding page (`/dashboard/onboarding`)
Server component (`src/app/dashboard/onboarding/page.tsx`) — calls `ensureSeller()`, queries full seller fields, redirects back to `/dashboard` if already complete, then renders `<OnboardingWizard>` with props.

### Wizard steps
- **Step 0 — Welcome**: greeting with maker name, "Get Started →" button
- **Step 1 — Your Profile (20%)**: display name, tagline, bio, avatar upload (uses `ProfileAvatarUploader`)
- **Step 2 — Your Shop (40%)**: city, state, years in business, return policy, shipping policy, accepts custom orders toggle
- **Step 3 — Get Paid (60%)**: Stripe Connect button (green checkmark if already connected); "Connect Stripe →" calls `/api/stripe/connect/create` with `{ returnUrl: "/dashboard/onboarding" }` so user returns to step 4 after Stripe onboarding
- **Step 4 — Your First Listing (80%)**: "Create a Listing →" link to `/dashboard/listings/new`; shows green checkmark if listings already exist
- **Step 5 — Done! (100%)**: checklist summary of completed vs skipped steps; "Go to My Dashboard →" calls `completeOnboarding()` which sets `onboardingComplete = true` and redirects to `/dashboard`

### Files
- `src/app/dashboard/onboarding/actions.ts` — `saveStep1`, `saveStep2`, `advanceStep(targetStep)`, `completeOnboarding`
- `src/app/dashboard/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx` — `"use client"` wizard; local `step` state starts at `initialStep`; each step uses `onSubmit` handlers calling server actions
- `src/app/dashboard/onboarding/page.tsx` — server component wrapper

### Stripe connect route update
`POST /api/stripe/connect/create` now accepts optional `{ returnUrl: "/path" }` in the request body (relative paths only for security). Falls back to `/seller/payouts?onboarded=1` if not provided.

### Progress persistence
Each "Save & Continue" or "Skip" calls `advanceStep(n)` which writes `onboardingStep` to the DB. If the seller navigates away and returns to `/dashboard/onboarding`, they resume at their saved step.

## Legal Pages (complete — updated 2026-04-01)

`/terms` and `/privacy` — both server components, publicly accessible (added to middleware public matcher), linked in site footer (`src/app/layout.tsx`). Both display a red **DRAFT — Under Attorney Review** banner. Both have a Table of Contents with anchor links and are mobile responsive / print-friendly.

### Terms of Service (`/terms`) — 33 sections, 60+ subsections

Comprehensive legal update deployed 2026-04-01 (commit 6537bf6). 426 insertions across both files. 40+ changes covering payment infrastructure, federal compliance, consumer protection, product safety, and general provisions.

### Privacy Policy (`/privacy`) — 13 sections

**Section 4 — Sharing:**
- 4.1 — Shippo sub-processor disclosure (carriers: USPS, UPS, FedEx)

**Section 10 — International Transfers:** US-only framing ("Platform is intended for use within the United States")

### Known Issues (to fix before launch)

- **Terms 6.3 redundant sentence** — "Payout timing is governed by Stripe's standard payout schedule." appears before the replacement sentence. Delete the first sentence. *(Commit c7bde34 fixed this)*
- **Privacy Section 10 duplicate paragraph** — "By using the Platform, you consent..." and "If you access the Platform from outside the United States, you consent..." were back to back. First deleted. *(Commit c7bde34 fixed this)*
- **TOC clutter** — Both TOCs showed inline subsection names next to main section titles. Simplified to main section titles only. *(Commit c7bde34 fixed this)*
- **Duplicate Feedback clause** — Section 11.6 and Section 33.11 both assign user feedback IP to Grainline. Attorney should decide which to keep (recommend keeping 33.11, removing 11.6).
- **Section 8.3 vs 9.4 inconsistency** — 8.3 said case decisions are "final and binding on both parties"; 9.4 allows a 7-day re-review. *(Fixed — 8.3 now reads "final, subject to the re-review process described in Section 9.4")*

### Phase 2 — Deferred Items (after attorney review)

These items were identified in a comprehensive 196-item attorney discussion list but deferred from the implementation round. They should be addressed after the attorney meeting:

**Terms additions (medium priority):** seller death/incapacitation, seller bankruptcy, platform shutdown/wind-down, commission room expiration timeframe, maker-to-maker transaction roles, cooperative/multi-person shop definition, minimum/maximum listing price, seller non-compete/price parity, seller-to-seller dispute mechanism, recall obligation framework, local pickup liability confirmation, CITES/Lacey Act for protected wood, food contact surface self-certification field, seller return policy as binding contract clarification

**Attorney judgment calls (critical):** money transmitter licensing (federal felony risk — must confirm Stripe Connect exemption), arbitration venue (Travis vs. Brazos County), "venue only" defense strength given AI review/Guild badges/recommendations, clickwrap vs. browsewrap (enforceability of arbitration clause), IC classification risk level, Section 230 and AI review liability, product liability as marketplace (Amazon precedent), unlimited one-way indemnification (unconscionability risk), UCC Article 2 gap (seller warranties to buyer)

### Pre-Launch Blockers (legal/business)

- ✅ Texas LLC filed
- ✅ EIN obtained
- ✅ Business bank account opened
- ✅ Business address — Registered Agents Inc., 5900 Balcones Drive STE 100, Austin, TX 78731 (filled in Terms + Privacy)

- Business insurance — general liability + cyber liability + marketplace product liability (post-launch)

### Canada Expansion Guide

A standalone guide exists for re-adding Canada when demand justifies it (~1–2 days of work, requires attorney meeting first). Key items: PIPEDA cookie consent, Quebec French language requirements (Bill 96), Canadian provincial consumer protection conflicts with arbitration clause, GST/HST registration, cross-border shipping/customs, currency conversion. Middleware change is one line; legal and compliance changes are the bulk of the work.

## UptimeRobot Monitoring (complete)

UptimeRobot configured to ping `https://thegrainline.com/api/health` every 10 minutes. `/api/health` is a static endpoint (`force-static`, no DB, no auth, <5ms response). NotificationBell polls reduced to 10min (600000ms). UnreadBadge polls reduced to 10min (600000ms, was 15s).

## UX Restructuring (complete — 2026-03-30)

### Navigation changes
- **"Dashboard" → "Workshop"** in all nav links and the dashboard page heading
- **Workshop link** only shown in header for users with a seller profile (`hasSeller` flag from `GET /api/me`)
- **"My Account" link** added to both desktop and mobile nav for all signed-in users → `/account`
- **Cart icon** always visible (signed-out users go to `/cart` which shows a sign-in prompt)
- **`GET /api/me`** now returns `{ role, hasSeller }` — `hasSeller` is `true` if the user has a `SellerProfile` row

### Mobile drawer fixes
- **X close button** — added `relative z-[60]` so it sits above the backdrop overlay
- **Messages row** — replaced the complex div/MessageIconLink combo with a single `<Link href="/messages">` wrapping a `MessageCircle` icon + "Messages" text. The unread badge is still available on the desktop `MessageIconLink` icon
- **Drawer styling** (2026-04-02) — `rounded-l-2xl overflow-hidden` on drawer panel; `pb-[calc(1rem+env(safe-area-inset-bottom))]` on bottom avatar container for iPhone home indicator clearance
- **Signed-out fetch cleanup** (2026-04-02) — `loadMe` replaced with unified `loadAll`; cart and notification fetches only fire when signed in (gates on `/api/me` success) — eliminates 401/404 console noise for signed-out users

### Blog now public
- `/blog` and `/blog/(.*)` added to `isPublic` in `src/middleware.ts`
- `/api/blog(.*)` and `/api/search(.*)` also added as public — blog viewing + search suggestions require no auth
- Writing requires `ensureSeller()` (unchanged); commenting requires auth (handled in API route, unchanged)

### Onboarding redirect fix
- `dashboard/page.tsx` redirect to `/dashboard/onboarding` now only fires when `sellerProfile` exists AND `onboardingComplete === false`
- Pure buyers who land on `/dashboard` (which calls `ensureSeller()` and creates a profile) will still be redirected to onboarding — the fix prevents any edge case where `guildSeller` is null from triggering a redirect

### Stripe Connect — real account status check
- `dashboard/onboarding/page.tsx` now calls `stripe.accounts.retrieve(stripeAccountId)` when a Stripe account ID exists
- Passes `hasStripeAccount: boolean` and `chargesEnabled: boolean` to `OnboardingWizard`
- Wizard Step 3 now shows three states:
  1. **No account** → "Connect Stripe →" button
  2. **Account exists but `charges_enabled = false`** → amber warning card + "Continue Stripe Setup →" button
  3. **Account fully connected (`charges_enabled = true`)** → green "Stripe Connected ✓" banner

### `/account` page (new)
`src/app/account/page.tsx` — server component for all signed-in users:
- **Header** — avatar, name, email
- **My Orders** — 5 most recent orders with thumbnail, title, total, status badge, "View" link; "View all orders →" to `/account/orders`
- **Saved Items** — horizontal scroll row of 6 most recently favorited listings
- **Account Settings** — shows name/email with note to update via Clerk
- **Your Workshop** (sellers only) — active listing count, completed order count, links to `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/blog`, `/dashboard/blog/new`

### `/account/orders` page (new)
`src/app/account/orders/page.tsx` — paginated full order history (20/page) with order items, totals, tracking numbers, status badges, and per-order detail links.

## Vacation Mode (complete — 2026-03-31)

Sellers can pause their shop while away. Migration: `20260331000843_vacation_mode`

### Schema additions on `SellerProfile`
- `vacationMode Boolean @default(false)` — whether vacation mode is currently active
- `vacationReturnDate DateTime?` — optional expected return date shown to buyers
- `vacationMessage String?` — optional message to buyers (max 200 chars)

### Dashboard seller settings (`/dashboard/seller`)
- New **Vacation Mode** card at top of page, rendered by `VacationModeForm` (`"use client"` component)
- Toggle switch to enable/disable vacation mode
- Enabling shows a warning banner (existing orders unaffected, buyers can still message you) with confirm/cancel
- When ON: optional return date picker + optional vacation message textarea (200 char limit)
- Save calls `POST /api/seller/vacation` which updates the three fields

### Dashboard home (`/dashboard`)
- Amber banner when vacation mode is active: "Your listings are hidden and new orders are blocked." + return date (if set) + "Turn off vacation mode →" link to `/dashboard/seller`

### Listing suppression
- **Browse** (`/browse`): `seller: { vacationMode: false }` added to main `where` clause
- **Homepage** (`/`): added to both "Fresh from the Workshop" and "Collector Favorites" queries
- **Similar items** (`/api/listings/[id]/similar`): `AND sp."vacationMode" = false` added to both raw SQL paths; `seller: { vacationMode: false }` added to Prisma fallback

### Checkout + cart blocking
- **`POST /api/cart/add`** — returns 400 if `listing.seller.vacationMode` is true
- **`POST /api/cart/checkout`** — returns 400 if the seller is on vacation
- **`POST /api/cart/checkout/single`** — returns 400 if the seller is on vacation

### Public profile notices
- **`/seller/[id]`** — amber banner above the banner image when `seller.vacationMode === true`; shows return date and vacation message if set; "Browse other makers →" link
- **`/seller/[id]/shop`** — same amber banner above the header bar

## Seller Analytics Dashboard (complete — 2026-03-31, metrics cleanup 2026-03-31)

`/dashboard/analytics` — **client component** (`"use client"`). Fetches data from `GET /api/seller/analytics?range=` on mount and on range change. Shows loading skeletons while fetching.

### Schema addition
- **`SellerProfile.profileViews Int @default(0)`** — incremented fire-and-forget on every `GET /seller/[id]` page load; migration `20260331010407_seller_profile_views`

### Schema addition (migration `20260331022628_listing_view_daily`)
- **`ListingViewDaily`** — `id`, `listingId` → `Listing`, `sellerProfileId` → `SellerProfile`, `date DateTime` (midnight UTC), `views Int @default(0)`, `clicks Int @default(0)`; `@@unique([listingId, date])`, `@@index([sellerProfileId, date])`, `@@index([date])`; back-relations `viewDailies ListingViewDaily[]` on both `Listing` and `SellerProfile`

### View/click tracking (updated)
- **`POST /api/listings/[id]/view`** — after incrementing `listing.viewCount`, fire-and-forgets an upsert on `ListingViewDaily` for today's bucket (increment `views`). **Listing views = times listing detail page was opened** (not card impressions).
- **`POST /api/listings/[id]/click`** — same pattern for `clicks`; `clicks` field retained on `ListingViewDaily` for future use but no longer surfaced in analytics UI
- Both routes first `findUnique` to get `sellerId` (needed for `sellerProfileId` on create)
- **Impression tracking (Intersection Observer) intentionally deferred** — not worth the complexity until sellers request it

### API routes
- **`GET /api/seller/analytics`** — accepts `?range=today|yesterday|week|last7|month|last30|year|last365|alltime`; returns full analytics JSON including overview, engagement, chart data (with all time buckets), top listings, rating over time, guild metrics; `chartGrouping` is `'hour'` for today/yesterday, `'day'` for week/last7/month/last30, `'month'` for year/last365, `'year'` for alltime; all DB queries use raw SQL for bucketing; guild metrics auto-recalculated if stale (>24h). Rating-over-time SQL uses `AVG(r."ratingX2") / 2.0` (Review stores `ratingX2` not `rating`). `alltime` start date uses seller's `createdAt` so year buckets are accurate.
- Engagement stats are **range-aware** — uses `ListingViewDaily.aggregate` with `date: { gte, lte }`; Listing Clicks + Click-through Rate (views/clicks, null when no click data) restored to UI
- **Conversion rate**: `number | null` — `null` when `totalViews === 0` but orders exist (tracking wasn't active yet); capped at 100%; `0` when both are 0. Frontend displays "—" for null
- **Click-through Rate** (CTR): views ÷ clicks — `null` when `totalClicks === 0`; capped at 100%; frontend displays "—" for null
- Cart abandonment is range-aware: Prisma `cartItem.findMany` + `orderItem.findMany` in the same date range; listings purchased in range are excluded from abandonment count
- Chart `views` buckets populated from real `ListingViewDaily` data: day grouping by YYYY-MM-DD; month grouping by YYYY-MM; year grouping by YYYY; hour grouping distributes daily total evenly across elapsed hours (today: hours 0–currentHour; yesterday: all 24)
- **`GET /api/seller/analytics/recent-sales`** — returns last 10 paid orders for this seller's items (split from main route to keep range-change responses fast)

### Data retention
- Monthly guild-metrics cron (`/api/cron/guild-metrics`) deletes `ListingViewDaily` records older than 2 years at the end of each run

### Bucket generation (API)
- **`generateHourBuckets`** — always generates all 24 hours (0–23); views/clicks distributed evenly across elapsed hours (today: currentHour+1; yesterday: 24)
- **`generateWeekBuckets`** — "week" range only; always 7 buckets Mon–Sun with labels 'Mon', 'Tue', …, 'Sun'
- **`generateDayBuckets`** — used for last7/month/last30; uses actual date range with 'Mar 15' style labels
- **`generateMonthBuckets`** — short month labels only ('Jan', 'Feb', etc.) — used for year/last365
- **`generateYearBuckets`** — used for alltime; yields one bucket per calendar year labeled '2025', '2026', etc.
- All bucket generators produce the full set of buckets first, then merge DB results in — zero values fill gaps

### Analytics nav
- "Analytics" button in Workshop nav (BarChart icon, links to `/dashboard/analytics`)

### Page sections (A–G)

**A — Overview (4 stat cards)**: Total Revenue, Total Orders, Avg Order Value, Active Listings — all range-aware except Active Listings (always current)

**B — Engagement (10 stat cards)**: Listing Views, Listing Clicks (range-aware), Click-through Rate (views÷clicks, "—" when null), Conversion Rate (orders÷views, "—" when null — null when view tracking wasn't yet active), Profile Visits (all-time from `profileViews`), Cart Abandoned (range-aware), Saved/Favorites (range-filtered, label "new saves this period"), Watching (range-filtered, label "new watchers this period"), Repeat Buyer Rate (all-time), Avg Processing Time (range-filtered via `createdAt`, label "order to shipped · this period"). `repeatBuyerRate` and `profileViews` intentionally remain all-time. Chart views populate going forward only — no historical data before `ListingViewDaily` was added.

**C — Performance Chart**: SVG line chart (inline, no external lib); 9 time range pill selectors; metric selector tabs (Revenue / Orders / Views); colors: revenue `#D97706` (amber-600), orders `#4F46E5` (indigo-600), views `#0D9488` (teal-600); gradient area fill via `<linearGradient>` (15% → 0% opacity); dashed gridlines (`strokeDasharray="4 4"`, `opacity={0.5}`); hollow dots for ≤20 points (white fill, colored stroke, strokeWidth=2); invisible hit-target rects for >20 points; **interactive active data point**: on hover/tap, shows a vertical dashed guide line (stone-300, `strokeDasharray="3 3"`) + enlarged hollow dot (r=6, white fill, colored stroke) at the hovered point; mouse leave on SVG clears active state; both `onMouseEnter` and `onClick` on hit rects for mobile tap support; white card tooltip (`bg-white border border-stone-200/60 rounded-lg shadow-md`); Y-axis uses `getYTicks(maxVal)`; X-axis label thinning with rotation when >14 buckets; "No data for this period" overlay when all values are zero

**D — Top Listings (top 8 by all-time revenue, showing 5)**: photo (80×80) + title + revenue/units row (no avg price) + engagement row (👁 views · 🖱 clicks · ♥ favorites · 🔔 watching · $/day)

**E — Guild Metrics**: range-independent metrics table (avg rating, on-time shipping, response rate, account age, open cases, completed sales); color-coded rates; Guild Master eligibility panel with human-readable failure descriptions

**F — Rating Over Time** (only shown if data exists): monthly list — `"Nov 2025: 4.8 ★ (3 reviews)"`

**G — Recent Sales**: last 10 paid orders table (date, item, buyer first name, amount, status badge); fetched from separate `/recent-sales` endpoint

### Dashboard + inventory listing stats
- **`/dashboard/page.tsx`** listings query: added `_count: { select: { favorites: true, stockNotifications: true } }` to include; each card shows `👁 X · 🖱 X · ♥ X · 🔔 X` below the status badge; `take: 6` (most recently updated) added (2026-04-13)
- **`/dashboard/inventory/page.tsx`** query: same `_count` addition; `InventoryRow.tsx` type extended with `viewCount`, `clickCount`, `_count`; stats row shown below price

## Following System (complete — 2026-03-31)

Migration: `20260331053935_following_system`

### Schema additions
- **`Follow`** — `id`, `followerId` → `User @relation("UserFollows")`, `sellerProfileId` → `SellerProfile`; `@@unique([followerId, sellerProfileId])`, `@@index([sellerProfileId])`, `@@index([followerId])`; back-relations `follows Follow[] @relation("UserFollows")` on `User`, `followers Follow[]` on `SellerProfile`
- **`SavedBlogPost`** — `id`, `userId` → `User`, `blogPostId` → `BlogPost`; `@@unique([userId, blogPostId])`, `@@index([userId])`, `@@index([blogPostId])`; back-relations `savedBlogPosts SavedBlogPost[]` on `User`, `savedBy SavedBlogPost[]` on `BlogPost`
- **`SellerBroadcast`** — `id`, `sellerProfileId` → `SellerProfile`, `message`, `imageUrl?`, `sentAt`, `recipientCount`; `@@index([sellerProfileId])`, `@@index([sentAt])`; back-relation `broadcasts SellerBroadcast[]` on `SellerProfile`
- **`NotificationType` additions**: `FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_LISTING`, `FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_BLOG`, `SELLER_BROADCAST`

### API routes
- **`GET/POST/DELETE /api/follow/[sellerId]`** — GET: returns `{ following, followerCount }` (auth optional); POST: upserts Follow, sends `NEW_FOLLOWER` notification to seller, returns `{ following: true, followerCount }`; DELETE: removes Follow. Added to middleware public list for GET.
- **`GET/POST /api/seller/broadcast`** — POST: creates `SellerBroadcast`, fire-and-forgets `SELLER_BROADCAST` notifications to all followers; GET: paginates the seller's broadcast history (10/page)
- **`GET/POST/DELETE /api/blog/[slug]/save`** — GET: returns `{ saved }` (auth optional); POST/DELETE: upserts/deletes `SavedBlogPost`

### Components
- **`FollowButton`** (`src/components/FollowButton.tsx`) — `"use client"`; props: `sellerProfileId`, `sellerUserId`, `initialFollowing`, `initialCount`, `size?: 'sm'|'md'`; optimistic toggle; 401 → redirect to sign-in; shows "Follow · N" or "Following ✓ · N"
- **`SaveBlogButton`** (`src/components/SaveBlogButton.tsx`) — `"use client"`; bookmark icon (filled amber when saved, outline when not); props: `slug`, `initialSaved`; 401 → redirect to sign-in
- **`BroadcastComposer`** (`src/components/BroadcastComposer.tsx`) — `"use client"`; textarea + send button; fetches/displays past broadcasts on mount; shows follower count

### FollowButton placement
- `/seller/[id]` — in the maker's name row (hidden for own profile)
- `/seller/[id]/shop` — in the shop header bar (`size="sm"`)
- `/listing/[id]` — below the seller's acceptingNewOrders badge (hidden for own listing)
- `/account/following` — on each followed-maker card (`size="sm"`)

### SaveBlogButton placement
- `/blog` — overlaid on each grid card (`absolute top-2 right-2 z-10`)
- `/blog/[slug]` — next to the post title (`flex items-start gap-3`)
- `/account/saved?tab=posts` — overlaid on each saved post card

### Notifications sent
- New listing from followed maker → `FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_LISTING` to all followers (fire-and-forget in `dashboard/listings/new/page.tsx`; first 500 followers also receive `sendNewListingFromFollowedMakerEmail`)
- New published blog post from followed maker → `FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_BLOG` to all followers (fire-and-forget in `dashboard/blog/new/page.tsx`)
- Seller broadcast → `SELLER_BROADCAST` to all followers (fire-and-forget in `/api/seller/broadcast`)

### Pages
- **`/account/feed`** — unified feed of listings, blog posts, and broadcasts from followed sellers (last 90 days); sorted newest-first; paginated 20/page; empty state with "Find Makers to Follow" CTA
- **`/account/following`** — list of all followed makers with avatar, tagline, location, follower/listing counts, follow date, and inline `FollowButton` to unfollow
- **`/account/saved`** — tabbed page (Listings | Blog Posts); replaces `/dashboard/saved` (which now redirects here); listings tab mirrors old saved page; posts tab shows `SavedBlogPost` records with `SaveBlogButton` for unsaving
- **`/dashboard/seller`** — "Shop Updates" section at bottom with `BroadcastComposer`
- **`/admin/broadcasts`** — paginated list of all broadcasts with text search, delete action, seller name/email, recipient count, timestamp

### Homepage "From Your Makers"
Shown only when the signed-in user follows ≥ 3 makers. Fetches up to 6 recent listings + blog posts from followed sellers (last 30 days). Horizontal scroll row identical to Fresh/Favorites sections. "See full feed →" link to `/account/feed`. Section renders before "Stories from the Workshop".

### Nav additions
- `Rss` icon added to `src/components/icons/index.tsx`
- Desktop header: RSS icon link to `/account/feed` (signed-in only), between "My Account" and notification bell
- Mobile drawer: "Your Feed" link with `Rss` icon between "Messages" and "Workshop"

## Following System Bug Fixes (complete — 2026-03-31)

Post-deployment bug fixes and gap fills:

### Crash fix — `/account/feed`
- Root cause: nested `<Link>` (anchor) elements inside listing/blog feed cards caused React 19 hydration errors ("something splintered")
- Fix: restructured listing/blog cards — outer `<Link>` wraps photo only; title/price/date in a second sibling `<Link>`; seller chip is an independent `<Link>` (no nesting)
- Broadcast cards were unaffected (already used a `<div>` wrapper)

### `/account/page.tsx` additions
- Added `followCount` to parallel `Promise.all` query
- New "Following" section showing maker count + "View feed →" + "Manage →" links
- "View all saved →" link corrected from `/dashboard/saved` to `/account/saved`
- Sections renumbered 1–6

### Broadcast rate limiting (`/api/seller/broadcast/route.ts`)
- Added 7-day rate limit: returns 429 with "Next available: [date]" message if last broadcast < 7 days ago
- Notification link changed from `/seller/[id]` to `/account/feed` (followers land on feed)
- Added `sellersOnly` body param: filters `Follow` query to followers who have a `sellerProfile`

### `BroadcastComposer.tsx` updates
- Shows 429 rate limit error message with date
- Added "Send to: All followers / Sellers only" radio toggle

### `SaveBlogButton.tsx` — icon visibility
- Both saved/unsaved states now use white icon with `drop-shadow(0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.5))` so bookmark is visible on dark cover images

### Homepage "From Your Makers" position
- Moved from before "Stories from the Workshop" to the TOP of the main content section (first item after the map, before Shop by Category)

### Follower notifications on status change (`dashboard/page.tsx`)
- `setStatus` now notifies followers via `FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_LISTING` when a listing transitions from non-ACTIVE → ACTIVE (fire-and-forget)
- `createNotification` import added

### Follower notifications on blog publish (`dashboard/blog/[id]/edit/page.tsx`)
- `updateBlogPost` now notifies followers via `FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_BLOG` on first publish (non-PUBLISHED → PUBLISHED) for maker posts with a `sellerProfileId` (fire-and-forget)
- `createNotification` import added

### `/account/following/page.tsx` — latest listing
- Added `listings` to Prisma select: top 1 ACTIVE non-private listing with photo, title, price
- Renders a small thumbnail (40×40) + title + price below stats row; shows "No active listings" when empty

### `/seller/[id]/page.tsx` — latest broadcast card
- Queries `prisma.sellerBroadcast.findFirst` for most recent broadcast
- Shows a teal "📢 Shop Update" card above Featured Work if broadcast is < 30 days old

## Search Bar, Blog Search & Commission Room (complete — 2026-03-31)

### Header search bar — always visible on desktop
- Removed `showSearch` condition that limited the search bar to `/` and `/browse`
- Now rendered with `hidden md:flex flex-1 max-w-[400px]` on every page in the desktop header

### Header declutter + avatar sync (complete — 2026-04-01)
- **Desktop nav reduced** from 12+ items to: Logo, Search, Browse, Blog, Commission Room, bell, messages, cart, avatar dropdown
- **`UserButton` replaced** with `UserAvatarMenu` (`src/components/UserAvatarMenu.tsx`) — custom click-to-open dropdown; avatar uses `avatarImageUrl ?? imageUrl ?? clerkUser.imageUrl` priority (seller custom avatar, Clerk fallback); avatar img has `rounded-full` on both trigger button and dropdown header avatar
- **Items in avatar dropdown**: My Account, Workshop (sellers only), Your Feed, Admin (admin/employee only), Manage Account (opens Clerk profile modal via `openUserProfile()`), Sign Out. Dropdown shows avatar + name at top.
- **Settings removed from dropdown** — accessible via "Notification preferences →" link on `/account` page instead
- **Clerk account access**: "Manage Account" button calls `openUserProfile()` from `useClerk()` — gives full Clerk profile modal (password, email, connected accounts)
- **Clerk modal z-index** (2026-04-02): `globals.css` adds `z-index: 9999 !important` on `.cl-modalContent`, `.cl-userProfileModal`, `[data-clerk-portal]` and `min-width: min(90vw, 800px)` on `.cl-userProfile-root` — fixes modal rendering behind site UI and left-sidebar clipping. `UserAvatarMenu` dropdown changed from `z-50` to `z-[200]`.
- **`/api/me`** now returns `name`, `imageUrl`, `avatarImageUrl` so the header dropdown renders the correct avatar without an extra Clerk API call
- Mobile drawer unchanged — My Account, Messages, Your Feed, Workshop, Admin remain as drawer links; drawer footer now shows `UserAvatarMenu` + name
- **`UserAvatarMenu` `dropDirection` prop** — `"down"` (default, desktop) or `"up"`; prop still exists but drawer no longer uses it
- **Mobile drawer bottom** — replaced `UserAvatarMenu` with inline avatar display + "Manage Account" and "Sign Out" buttons; `openUserProfile()` and `signOut()` called directly via `useClerk()` — avoids dropdown clipping by `overflow-hidden` on the drawer panel; Clerk modal opens as a portal above everything

### Search submit buttons (complete — 2026-04-02)
- **`SearchBar.tsx`** and **`BlogSearchBar.tsx`**: pill shape uses an **outer div** approach — `rounded-full overflow-hidden border bg-white focus-within:ring-2 focus-within:ring-neutral-300` clips both the input and button into the pill naturally. The `<input>` has **no border, no border-radius, no focus ring** of its own (`bg-transparent flex-1 focus:outline-none`). The submit button uses `rounded-r-full` and fills the right cap. This prevents double-border or broken pill shape.
- **Button height**: outer div uses `items-stretch` (not `items-center`) so the submit button fills the full height of the pill without needing fixed `py-` padding — button has `px-4` only.
- **User avatar button** (`UserAvatarMenu.tsx`): `rounded-full overflow-hidden bg-transparent border-0 p-0 cursor-pointer` — eliminates grey square/border artifact behind profile picture. `<img>` has `block` to remove inline baseline gap.
- Mobile search icon dropdown unchanged

### Blog Search System

#### GIN full-text indexes (migration `20260331171540_blog_search_indexes`)
- `@@index([title])` and `@@index([tags])` added to `BlogPost` schema (standard B-tree)
- Raw SQL GIN indexes added manually to migration: `BlogPost_search_idx` on `to_tsvector('english', title || excerpt || body)` for `ts_rank` relevance sorting; `BlogPost_tags_gin_idx` on `tags` array (note: Prisma drops `BlogPost_tags_gin_idx` on subsequent migrations — only B-tree `BlogPost_tags_idx` survives; full-text GIN index stays since Prisma doesn't manage it)

#### `GET /api/blog/search` (`src/app/api/blog/search/route.ts`)
- Query params: `?q=`, `?type=`, `?tags=` (comma-separated), `?sort=newest|relevant|alpha`, `?page=`, `?limit=12`
- When `q` + `sort=relevant`: raw SQL GIN `ts_rank` search returns ranked IDs, then Prisma fetches full records with type/tag filter; re-ordered by rank
- Otherwise: standard Prisma `contains` + `hasSome` query; `publishedAt desc` or `title asc`
- Returns `{ posts, total, page, totalPages, relatedTags }`

#### `GET /api/blog/search/suggestions` (`src/app/api/blog/search/suggestions/route.ts`)
- Three parallel queries: post titles via `similarity() > 0.2`, tags via `unnest ILIKE`, seller display names via `contains`
- **Blog search suggestions tag query**: uses `unnest(tags) AS tag` in the `FROM` clause, then filters on the `tag` column in `WHERE` — PostgreSQL does not allow `unnest()` directly in a `WHERE` clause
- Returns `{ suggestions: Array<{ type: "post"|"tag"|"author", label, slug?, tag? }> }` up to 8 items

#### `BlogSearchBar` component (`src/components/BlogSearchBar.tsx`)
- `"use client"` — full-width search input with magnifying glass icon, 300ms debounce, dropdown with Post/Topic/Maker labels
- Clicking a post suggestion navigates to `/blog/[slug]`; tag → `/blog?tags=...`; author → `/blog?bq=...`
- On submit: pushes `/blog?bq=...&sort=relevant`; clear button when value non-empty
- **Uses `?bq=` URL param** (not `?q=`) to avoid collision with header `SearchBar` which uses `?q=`. Suggestions fetch uses `?bq=`. Affected files: `BlogSearchBar.tsx`, `blog/page.tsx` (`sp.bq`), `api/blog/search/route.ts`, `api/blog/search/suggestions/route.ts`.

#### `/blog` page rewrite (`src/app/blog/page.tsx`)
- **searchParams**: now handles `bq` (blog search query), `type`, `tags` (comma-separated), `sort`, `page`
- `BlogSearchBar` rendered inside hero section
- **Sort tabs**: "Most Relevant" / "Newest" / "A–Z" shown only when `bq` is active
- **Active tag chips**: shown below tabs with × to remove individual tags
- **Search results header**: "X results for 'oak' in Maker Spotlights" composite label
- **"Browse by Topic" tag cloud**: shown below newsletter when no active search; 20 most-used tags via raw SQL `unnest`; 3 size tiers based on count ratio
- **No results state**: shows fallback tag cloud for discovery
- Featured post suppressed when searching

#### Blog post detail — related posts (`src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- **"More from the Workshop"** — 3-column grid of related posts (same type or overlapping tags, excluding current post); already implemented

#### Main site search updated (`SearchBar.tsx` + `src/app/api/search/suggestions/route.ts`)
- `/api/search/suggestions` now runs a 4th parallel query: blog title trigram similarity (`> 0.15`, limit 3); returns `{ suggestions: string[], blogs: [{slug, title}] }`
- `SearchBar.tsx` updated: handles new response shape; renders blog results below a divider with amber **"Post"** badge; clicking navigates to `/blog/[slug]`

### Commission Room (complete — nav-active as of 2026-03-31)

#### Schema (migration `20260331172348_commission_room`)
- **`CommissionStatus` enum**: `OPEN | IN_PROGRESS | FULFILLED | CLOSED | EXPIRED`
- **`CommissionRequest`** — `id`, `buyerId` → `User @relation("CommissionRequests")`, `title`, `description`, `category Category?`, `budgetMinCents?`, `budgetMaxCents?`, `timeline?`, `referenceImageUrls String[]`, `status CommissionStatus @default(OPEN)`, `interestedCount`, `expiresAt?`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`; `@@index([buyerId])`, `@@index([status, createdAt])`, `@@index([category])`
- **`CommissionInterest`** — `id`, `commissionRequestId`, `sellerProfileId`, `conversationId?`, `createdAt`; `@@unique([commissionRequestId, sellerProfileId])`; `@@index([sellerProfileId])`
- **`COMMISSION_INTEREST`** added to `NotificationType` enum
- Back-relations: `commissionRequests CommissionRequest[] @relation("CommissionRequests")` on `User`; `commissionInterests CommissionInterest[]` on `SellerProfile`

#### API routes
- **`GET/POST /api/commission`** — GET: paginated OPEN requests with category filter; POST: auth required, creates request (validates title ≤100, description ≤1000)
- **`GET/PATCH /api/commission/[id]`** — GET: full detail with interests; PATCH: owner-only status update to FULFILLED or CLOSED
- **`POST /api/commission/[id]/interest`** — seller auth required; creates `CommissionInterest`, upserts conversation (canonical sort, race-safe), increments `interestedCount`, sends `COMMISSION_INTEREST` notification to buyer; returns `{ conversationId, alreadyInterested }`

#### Pages
- **`/commission`** — public board; category filter tabs; request cards with title, truncated description, budget, timeline, first reference image thumbnail, buyer first name + avatar, time ago, interest count; `CommissionInterestButton` for sellers; "Post a Request" button
- **`/commission/new`** — client component; form: title (100 chars), description (1000 chars + counter), category dropdown, budget min/max dollar inputs, timeline text, reference image upload (UploadButton, up to 3); redirects to `/commission` on success
- **`/commission/[id]`** — full description, reference images gallery, budget/timeline/category meta, buyer first name + avatar, interested makers list (avatar + name + GuildBadge + seller profile link), owner "Mark as Fulfilled" / "Close Request" buttons (via `MarkStatusButtons` client component); sign-in prompt for unsigned-out sellers
- **`/account/commissions`** — buyer's requests list with status badges, interest counts, edit/view links; "Post a Request" CTA

#### Client components
- **`CommissionInterestButton`** — optimistic toggle; 401 → redirect sign-in; redirects to `/messages/[conversationId]` on success
- **`MarkStatusButtons`** — owner-only FULFILLED / CLOSED buttons using PATCH API

#### Navigation & discoverability
- `COMMISSION_ROOM_ENABLED = true` in `Header.tsx`; nav links shown in both desktop nav and mobile drawer
- **Middleware**: `/commission` and `/commission/((?!new)[^/]+)` added as public routes; `/commission/new` and `/account/commissions` require auth (default protected matcher)
- **Sitemap**: `/commission` at priority 0.7 daily; individual open commission request pages at priority 0.5 weekly with `updatedAt`

#### SEO (complete — 2026-04-01)
- **Commission index** (`/commission`): `metadata` updated to `title: "Custom Woodworking Commissions — Find a Maker | Grainline"` with a description mentioning posting requests and matching with local/national makers
- **Commission detail** (`/commission/[id]`): `generateMetadata` updated with:
  - Title pattern: `[Title] — [City, State] | Custom Woodworking Commission` (or "Ships Anywhere" for national requests)
  - Description: first 120 chars of description + budget range + interested count (capped at 160 chars)
  - `alternates.canonical` and OpenGraph tags
  - JSON-LD `Service` schema injected via `<script type="application/ld+json">`: includes `name`, `description` (first 160 chars), `url`, `provider` (Grainline org), `areaServed` (city/state from buyer's seller profile, or "United States" for national), `category: "Custom Woodworking"`, `offers.@type: "AggregateOffer"` with `lowPrice`/`highPrice` (when set), `priceCurrency: "USD"`, `offerCount: interestedCount`
- Main query now selects `isNational` and `buyer.sellerProfile.{ city, state }` for location resolution

#### Improvements (2026-03-31)
- **Explainer banner** always shown at top of commission board: "How the Commission Room works" (amber card)
- **Better empty state**: heading + description + filled "Post a Request →" button
- **`ImageLightbox` component** (`src/components/ImageLightbox.tsx`) — `"use client"`; thumbnail grid (96×96) + fullscreen modal with keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Escape), body scroll lock, prev/next buttons, counter; used on commission detail page
- **Interested seller notifications** — PATCH handler in `api/commission/[id]/route.ts` now notifies all sellers who expressed interest when buyer marks FULFILLED or CLOSED; uses `COMMISSION_INTEREST` notification type
- **Interested seller avatars** — `/account/commissions` shows up to 3 stacked avatars + count on each request card
- **Commission Room link** on listing detail page — inside the "Want something custom?" panel, adds "post a request in the Commission Room" link
- **`/account/page.tsx`** — new "Commission Requests" section linking to `/account/commissions` and `/commission`
- **`/account/commissions`** — query expanded to include up to 3 interested seller avatars per request

## Feed Improvements (complete — 2026-03-31)

Post-deployment round 2 fixes and enhancements:

### `/admin/broadcasts` crash fix
- Root cause: inline `onClick={(e) => { if (!confirm(...)) e.preventDefault() }}` on a `<button>` inside a server component — React 19 RSC cannot serialize inline event handler functions
- Fix: extracted delete button into `src/app/admin/broadcasts/DeleteBroadcastButton.tsx` (`"use client"` component); receives `id` and `action` (server action) as props; `page.tsx` passes `deleteBroadcast` server action as a prop

### `SaveBlogButton.tsx` — amber fill when saved
- Saved state now uses amber fill (`fill="#F59E0B"`, `stroke="#D97706"`) with drop shadow — visually distinct from the white unsaved outline on any background
- Unsaved state keeps white outline with drop shadow (unchanged)

### `/account/feed` — infinite scroll with cursor-based API
- **`src/app/api/account/feed/route.ts`** — new protected API route; cursor-based pagination (`?cursor=[ISO timestamp]&limit=20`, 20 items per batch); fetches listings + blog posts + broadcasts from followed sellers in parallel; merges and sorts by date desc; returns `{ items: FeedItem[], nextCursor: string | null, hasMore: boolean }`; 90-day cutoff on first load, cursor filter on subsequent pages; `guildLevel` included on listing/blog items; broadcasts mapped to `broadcastImageUrl` to avoid collision with listing `imageUrl`
- **`src/app/account/feed/FeedClient.tsx`** — new `"use client"` component; `IntersectionObserver` with `rootMargin: "300px"` sentinel triggers next page load before user reaches bottom; skeleton loading state (5 animated placeholder cards); empty state with "Browse Makers →" CTA; error banner with retry; "You're all caught up!" end-of-feed message; `FeedCard` renders listing (amber "New Listing" badge), blog (indigo "New Post" badge), and broadcast (teal "📢 Shop Update") cards with `timeAgo()` relative timestamp helper
- **`src/app/account/feed/page.tsx`** — rewritten as thin server auth wrapper; checks Clerk session, redirects to sign-in if unauthenticated, renders `<FeedClient />`; all data fetching moved client-side

## Listing Page Overhaul (complete — 2026-03-31)

Full redesign of `src/app/listing/[id]/page.tsx`. Zero TypeScript errors. Deployed.

### Layout changes
- **Breadcrumb** at top: Browse › Category › Title (each segment is a link)
- **`max-w-6xl`** container (wider than before)
- **`lg:grid-cols-2`** two-column layout (left = gallery, right = purchase panel)
- **Description** moved below the two-column area into its own `"About this piece"` section
- **Details table** below description: category (linked), listing type, processing, ships from
- **Map** moved below details (still shows pickup area)
- **"You might also like"** heading added above `SimilarItems`

### `ListingGallery` component (`src/components/ListingGallery.tsx`)
- `"use client"` — manages active photo index + lightbox state
- Main photo: `height: 500px`, `cursor-zoom-in`, photo counter overlay (`1 / N`)
- Click main photo → opens full lightbox with keyboard nav (Arrow keys + Escape)
- Horizontal scrollable thumbnail row below main photo; active thumbnail has `border-neutral-900` highlight
- Lightbox: prev/next buttons, close, counter

### `DescriptionExpander` component (`src/components/DescriptionExpander.tsx`)
- `"use client"` — desktop always shows full text; mobile truncates at 300 chars with "Read more" toggle

### `SellerGallery` component (`src/components/SellerGallery.tsx`)
- `"use client"` — keeps the existing grid layout on seller profile; adds click-to-open lightbox

### `CoverLightbox` component (`src/components/CoverLightbox.tsx`)
- `"use client"` — wraps any single image in a clickable button that opens a fullscreen lightbox; used on blog post cover and seller workshop image

### Purchase panel improvements
- **Price**: `text-3xl font-semibold`
- **Stock status**: rectangular badge (not pill), `In Stock · N available` / `Out of Stock` / `Made to order`
- **Buy buttons**: Buy Now first (full-width black), Add to Cart second (full-width bordered)
- **Gift wrapping notice** shown if seller offers it
- **Seller card**: 56px avatar, display name + Guild badge, tagline, seller star rating + count, city/state with pin icon, "Visit Shop" + Follow + Message buttons in a row

### UI Polish Pass (2026-04-01)
- Main photo: `rounded-lg overflow-hidden` on container
- Thumbnails: `rounded-md` on each thumbnail button
- Status badges ("Made to order", "In Stock", "Out of Stock"): changed from rectangular to `rounded-full` pills
- Purchase panel consolidated: "Want something custom?" panel and seller info card moved inside the main purchase panel as one continuous `card-section bg-white` card, separated by `border-t` dividers
- Tags: changed from square to `rounded-full` pills matching browse/hero tag styling
- Panel background: `bg-stone-50/50` → `card-section bg-white` (design system: never bg-stone-50 or any grey tint on card surfaces)

### SEO
- `generateMetadata` title: `{ absolute: "[Listing Title] by [Seller Name] — Grainline" }`

### Image Lightbox — wired everywhere
- **Review photos** (`ReviewsSection.tsx`) — `ImageLightbox` replaces `<a>` links for both "my review" and all other reviews
- **Seller gallery** (`seller/[id]/page.tsx`) — `SellerGallery` component (grid layout preserved, click opens lightbox)
- **Seller workshop image** (`seller/[id]/page.tsx`) — `CoverLightbox` component
- **Blog post cover** (`blog/[slug]/page.tsx`) — `CoverLightbox` component

## Commission System Improvements (complete — 2026-03-31)

### Part 3: Commission Chat Card
- **`Message.isSystemMessage Boolean @default(false)`** added to schema; migration `20260331182743_message_system_flag_commission_location`
- **`/api/commission/[id]/interest/route.ts`** — after creating conversation, fire-and-forgets a system message with `kind: "commission_interest_card"` containing: `commissionId`, `commissionTitle`, `sellerName`, `budgetMinCents`, `budgetMaxCents`, `timeline`
- **`ThreadMessages.tsx`** — renders `commission_interest_card` kind as a distinct card: gray left border in teal (`border-l-4 border-teal-400`), "📋 Commission Interest" header, seller name in bold, request title, budget, timeline, "View full request →" link

### Part 4: Commission Location Features
- **Schema** additions on `CommissionRequest`: `isNational Boolean @default(true)`, `lat Float?`, `lng Float?`, `radiusMeters Int? @default(80000)`; same migration as above
- **`/commission/new`** — "Who can see this request?" radio toggle (All makers nationwide / Local makers only); sends `isNational` to API; local scope error shown if buyer has no location set
- **`POST /api/commission`** — reads `isNational`; for local scope: fetches buyer's `sellerProfile.lat/lng`, returns 400 if not set, stores `lat`, `lng`, `isNational: false` on the record
- **Commission board** (`/commission/page.tsx`):
  - `?tab=near` URL param — "Near Me" tab only shown when viewer has location set (from their seller profile)
  - Near Me tab: Haversine raw SQL query; local non-national requests sorted first, then nationals; 80km radius
  - Distance badge on cards: `📍 X mi away` (green pill, shown when `!isNational && distanceMeters < 80000`)
  - `buildHref` preserves the `tab` param across pagination/category changes
  - Near Me SQL rewritten as `$queryRawUnsafe` with positional parameters ($1–$7) to fix crash from conditional SQL fragments in tagged template literal; `LEAST/GREATEST` clamps acos input to prevent NaN

## Bug Fix Session (complete — 2026-03-31)

Nine bugs fixed across listing page, commission room, and seller profile.

### Listing Gallery — lightbox not opening on click
- Root cause: hover overlay `div` (absolute inset-0) was intercepting click events before they reached the `img` tag (which had `onClick`)
- Fix: moved `onClick` to the outer container `div` for reliable click handling; added `pointer-events-none` to the decorative hover overlay

### Lightbox z-index — appears under Leaflet map
- Leaflet tiles render at z-index 200+; lightbox was `z-[200]` causing map to overlap
- Fix: all four lightbox components (`ListingGallery`, `ImageLightbox`, `SellerGallery`, `CoverLightbox`) updated to `z-[9999]`

### Leaflet map z-index — listing page
- Leaflet establishes a stacking context that can overlap other elements
- Fix: map section in `listing/[id]/page.tsx` wrapped in `<div style={{ position: 'relative', zIndex: 0 }}>`

### Mobile swipe support for lightboxes
- Added `touchStartX` / `touchEndX` `useRef` + `onTouchStart`/`onTouchEnd` handlers to `ListingGallery`, `ImageLightbox`, and `SellerGallery`; minimum 50px swipe threshold

### Main photo swipe — changes active index without opening lightbox
- `ListingGallery` main photo container (`src/components/ListingGallery.tsx`): added separate `mainTouchStartX` ref + `mainSwiped` boolean ref
- `handleMainTouchStart` / `handleMainTouchEnd` on the outer container: swipe ≥ 50px → changes `activeIndex` (prev/next photo); sets `mainSwiped = true`
- `onClick` checks `mainSwiped.current` before opening lightbox — if a swipe just occurred, resets the flag and returns early; a tap (< 10px movement) lets the click fire normally and opens the lightbox

### Workshop/story section layout (seller profile)
- Removed workshop image (`CoverLightbox`) from inside the story section
- Story section now only contains `storyTitle` + `storyBody` text
- New "From the Workshop" gallery section renders both `workshopImageUrl` and `galleryImageUrls` via updated `SellerGallery` component

### SellerGallery — combined images
- Updated `SellerGallery` to accept `workshopImageUrl?: string | null` and `images?: string[]`; internally merges them: `[workshopImageUrl, ...images].filter(Boolean)`
- All event handlers and lightbox state updated to use `allImages` length

### Workshop Gallery — dashboard seller settings
- New `GalleryUploader` client component (`src/components/GalleryUploader.tsx`) — shows existing images grid with remove buttons, UploadButton (galleryImage endpoint), hidden inputs per URL
- Added gallery upload section to `dashboard/seller/page.tsx` with heading "Workshop Gallery" and 8-photo max
- `updateSellerProfile` server action now reads `formData.getAll("galleryImageUrls")` and saves to `galleryImageUrls` field

### Duplicate "You might also like" heading
- `SimilarItems` component had its own `<h2>You Might Also Like</h2>` while listing page also had one
- Fix: removed `<h2>` from inside `SimilarItems`; outer `<section>` in listing page retains the heading

### Description field in new listing form
- Added `<textarea name="description">` (6 rows, 2000 char max) between title and price fields in `dashboard/listings/new/page.tsx`; server action already read and saved the field

### Draft system (2026-04-13)
- **Save as Draft button**: uses HTML button `name="saveAsDraft" value="true"` — no client component needed; Publish button uses `value="false"`; `createListing` reads `formData.get("saveAsDraft") === "true"` as FIRST line
- **Listing status**: `status: saveAsDraft ? "DRAFT" : "ACTIVE"` in `prisma.listing.create`
- **Draft redirect**: when `saveAsDraft`, redirects immediately to `/dashboard` after geo-metro mapping — skips ALL side effects (AI review, emails, follower notifications, syncListingsThreshold)
- **chargesEnabled gate**: if `!saveAsDraft && !seller.chargesEnabled` → `redirect("/dashboard/listings/new?error=stripe")`; page shows inline red error when `searchParams.error === "stripe"`; amber banner always shown when `!seller.chargesEnabled` (regardless of error param)
- **Save as Draft always works** regardless of chargesEnabled — sellers can draft listings before connecting Stripe

### Commission Room Near Me crash
- Root cause: `$queryRaw` tagged template literal treats `${}` expressions as SQL parameters; the conditional `${categoryValid ? \`AND cr.category = '${categoryFilter}'\` : \`\`}` was being passed as a bound parameter value instead of raw SQL, causing a PostgreSQL syntax error
- Fix: rewrote both queries (data + count) using `$queryRawUnsafe` with positional parameters; added `LEAST(1.0, GREATEST(-1.0, ...))` clamping on `acos` arguments to prevent NaN
- **Commission Near Me raw SQL**: category filter uses positional parameters (`$8` in select, `$4` in count) — never string interpolation. Direct string interpolation was causing a `$4` syntax error when a category was selected (parameter numbering shifted). Select and count use different variables (`categoryConditionSelect` / `categoryConditionCount`) because their param counts differ.

## User Ban System (complete — 2026-04-01)

### Schema additions on `User`
- `banned Boolean @default(false)`, `bannedAt DateTime?`, `banReason String?`, `bannedBy String?` — set/cleared by admin ban actions
- `adminActions AdminAuditLog[] @relation("AdminActions")` — back-relation

### `AdminAuditLog` model
Full audit trail for admin actions with 24-hour undo window. Fields: `action` (string enum like `BAN_USER`, `APPROVE_LISTING`, etc.), `targetType`, `targetId`, `reason?`, `metadata Json`, `undone Boolean`, `undoneAt?`, `undoneBy?`, `undoneReason?`. Migration: `20260401011017_ban_audit_ai_review_snapshot`.

### Utilities (`src/lib/`)
- **`audit.ts`** — `logAdminAction(...)` upserts an `AdminAuditLog` row; `undoAdminAction({ logId, adminId, reason })` validates 24h window, performs action-specific rollback (BAN_USER → unban + restore Stripe/vacation; REMOVE_LISTING/HOLD_LISTING → restore ACTIVE), marks log undone, creates `UNDO_*` audit entry
- **`ban.ts`** — `banUser({ userId, adminId, reason })`: sets banned fields, calls `sellerProfile.updateMany({ chargesEnabled: false, vacationMode: true })`, closes open commission requests, logs `BAN_USER` action; `unbanUser(...)`: clears banned fields, restores Stripe if account exists, logs `UNBAN_USER`

### API routes
- `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/ban` — ADMIN only; bans user with reason; blocks self-ban and admin-to-admin ban
- `DELETE /api/admin/users/[id]/ban` — ADMIN only; unbans user
- `POST /api/admin/audit/[id]/undo` — ADMIN only; undoes action within 24h window
- `PATCH /api/admin/listings/[id]/review` — ADMIN/EMPLOYEE; `action: "approve"` → ACTIVE + `LISTING_APPROVED` notification; `action: "reject"` → HIDDEN + `LISTING_REJECTED` notification + reason required

### Enforcement
- **Browse** (`/browse/page.tsx`): `seller: { user: { banned: false } }` added to main query
- **Homepage** (`/page.tsx`): same filter on Fresh from Workshop + Collector Favorites
- **Similar items** (`/api/listings/[id]/similar`): banned filter on both raw SQL paths + Prisma fallback
- **Seller profile** (`/seller/[id]`): redirects to `/not-found` if `seller.user.banned`
- **`ensureUser`**: throws `"Your account has been suspended. Contact support@thegrainline.com"` if user is banned (sign-in fails gracefully)
- **`/banned` page** (`src/app/banned/page.tsx`): branded suspension page with support email; `robots: { index: false }`

### Client components
- **`BanUserButton`** — `window.prompt` for reason, optimistic toggle, POST/DELETE to ban route
- **`UndoActionButton`** — shows "Undo" within 24h, "Expired" after; `window.prompt` for reason
- **`ReviewListingButtons`** — Approve (no reason needed) / Reject (prompts for reason); calls `PATCH /api/admin/listings/[id]/review`; calls `router.refresh()` on success

### `LISTING_APPROVED` and `LISTING_REJECTED` notification types
Added to `NotificationType` enum. Sent to seller on admin approve/reject. `createNotification` preference check applies (type string `"LISTING_APPROVED"` / `"LISTING_REJECTED"`).

## AI Listing Review (complete — 2026-04-01)

### Schema additions on `Listing`
- `aiReviewFlags String[] @default([])` — flags returned by AI review
- `aiReviewScore Float?` — confidence score from AI (0.0–1.0)
- `reviewedByAdmin Boolean @default(false)` — set to true on admin approve/reject
- `reviewedAt DateTime?` — timestamp of admin review

### `PENDING_REVIEW` and `REJECTED` listing statuses
`PENDING_REVIEW`: listings held for admin review. Hidden from all public surfaces. Visible to seller (amber "Under Review" badge) and admins in `/admin/review`.

`REJECTED`: **SECURITY FIX (2026-04-15)** — admin-rejected listings now use `REJECTED` status (was `HIDDEN`, which let sellers click "Unhide" to bypass moderation). `rejectionReason String?` field added to Listing model. Migration: `20260415050609_add_rejected_listing_status`.

- **Seller sees**: red "Rejected" badge on dashboard + shop page; rejection reason banner on edit page; "Resubmit for Review" button (triggers full AI review again) + Edit + Delete. No Unhide button.
- **`unhideListingAction`** (shop): blocks `REJECTED` status (returns early).
- **`markAvailableAction`** (shop): blocks `REJECTED` status (returns early).
- **`setStatus`** (dashboard/page.tsx): blocks `REJECTED` → `ACTIVE` and `REJECTED` → `HIDDEN` transitions (returns early). REJECTED listings show Edit, Preview, Resubmit, Delete on My Listings — no Hide/Unhide/Mark sold.
- **`ResubmitButton`** (`src/components/ResubmitButton.tsx`): "use client" component; calls `publishListingAction` with `useTransition`; shows inline toast. Used on dashboard My Listings for REJECTED status.
- **`publishListingAction`**: clears `rejectionReason` on re-publish; runs full AI review flow.
- **Admin approve** (`/api/admin/listings/[id]/review`): Zod schema fixed — `reason` changed from `.optional()` to `.nullish()` (accepts `null` from `JSON.stringify`). Clears `rejectionReason: null` when approving. Handles PENDING_REVIEW and REJECTED → ACTIVE.
- **Admin reject** (`/api/admin/listings/[id]/review`): sets `status: 'REJECTED'`, saves `rejectionReason`, sends `LISTING_REJECTED` notification with reason.
- **Public surfaces**: seller profile listing query fixed — was `where: { sellerId }` (no status filter, showed REJECTED/HIDDEN/DRAFT on public page). Now uses allowlist: `status: { in: ["ACTIVE", "SOLD", "SOLD_OUT"] }`. All other public queries already filtered by ACTIVE.
- **`DismissibleBanner`** (`src/components/DismissibleBanner.tsx`): "use client" wrapper; localStorage persistence keyed to rejected listing IDs (`dismissed-rejected-ids`). Reappears when a NEW listing gets rejected (new ID not in dismissed set).
- **Full audit (2026-04-15)**: 15 status-change locations found. All 4 seller-accessible paths to ACTIVE check for REJECTED. Admin paths (approve, undo) intentionally bypass.

### `reviewListingWithAI` (`src/lib/ai-review.ts`)
- **Model**: gpt-4o-mini with vision, temperature 0.1, max 300 tokens
- **Text review**: 13 explicit prohibited categories (counterfeit goods, unlicensed IP like Disney/Marvel/sports logos, regulated goods like firearms/tobacco/cannabis/Rx, weapons as weapons, adult content, hate symbols, protected species, medical claims, services disguised as goods, digital-only, mass-produced/dropshipped, scams/spam, non-woodworking primary goods)
- **Image review** (strict mode): up to 4 images at `detail: "low"` (~85 tokens/image). Rejects: graphics/logos/SVGs/clipart instead of product photos, headshots/portraits without visible product, stock photos, mismatched product images, sexualized content. Single-image listings rejected if image doesn't clearly show described product. When in doubt: reject (seller can resubmit with proper photos). Includes worked examples of both violations and valid listings in prompt.
- **Description quality**: under 20 chars or no product info → flag `low-quality-description` (new sellers get pass); 3+ listings with very low quality → reject; missing description → always reject.
- **Signature**: optional `imageUrls?: string[]` param — backward compatible; callers pass first 4 photo URLs from listing. Returns `{ approved, flags, confidence, reason }`.
- **Leniency**: 0-2 listing count = benefit of doubt on borderline cases, 3+ = standard strictness. Always reject clear violations regardless of seller experience.
- **Fallback**: returns `approved: true` on any error (API down, rate limit, no key) with manual review flag. Gracefully returns `{ approved: true, confidence: 1 }` if `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var is missing.
- **Error logging**: `console.error` on catch for debugging
- **Cost**: ~$0.0006 per listing with 4 images (~85 tokens per low-detail image)
- **Callers**: `dashboard/listings/new/page.tsx` (passes `imageUrls.slice(0, 4)` from form data) and `seller/[id]/shop/actions.ts` (`publishListingAction` — fetches first 4 photos via `prisma.photo.findMany`)
- **Duplicate detection**: `sellerId` (required) added to function signature. Before OpenAI call, counts listings with same title (case-insensitive) from same seller in last 24h. 2+ = auto-reject with `duplicate-listing` + `possible-spam` flags, bypasses OpenAI entirely (saves tokens). Uses SellerProfile ID (`seller.id`), not User ID. Duplicate check wrapped in try/catch — non-fatal on error, continues to AI review.

### Listing creation flow (`dashboard/listings/new/page.tsx`)
After `prisma.listing.create()`, AI review runs async in a try/catch:
1. Fetches seller's total listing count
2. Calls `reviewListingWithAI()`
3. `shouldHold = !aiResult.approved || aiResult.flags.length > 0 || aiResult.confidence < 0.8` — only auto-approves when AI returns approved:true AND zero flags AND confidence >= 0.8. Any flag, low confidence, or rejection → PENDING_REVIEW for admin. AI errors also default to PENDING_REVIEW (not ACTIVE).
4. If hold: updates listing to `PENDING_REVIEW`, saves `aiReviewFlags` + `aiReviewScore`, logs `AI_HOLD_LISTING` audit entry
5. If not held: listing stays `ACTIVE` — only when AI fully clears with no concerns

Dashboard shows amber "Under Review" badge + top-of-section banner when any listings are pending.

### Listing edit re-review
AI re-review triggers on ACTIVE listings when any substantive content changes. Three trigger points:

1. **Text field edits** (`dashboard/listings/[id]/edit/page.tsx` `updateListing`): title, description, category, or price (>50% change). Low-risk changes (tags, shipping, dimensions) do not trigger.
2. **Image additions** (`api/listings/[id]/photos/route.ts`): any new photos added to ACTIVE listing triggers re-review with the new image set.
3. **Image deletions** (`dashboard/listings/[id]/edit/page.tsx` `deletePhoto`): removing a photo from ACTIVE listing triggers re-review with remaining images.

All three paths use the same threshold: `!approved || flags.length > 0 || confidence < 0.8` → PENDING_REVIEW. AI errors also send to admin queue. Non-fatal on infrastructure errors (listing stays ACTIVE only if try/catch catches a non-AI error).

- Scope: only ACTIVE listings. Edits to DRAFT, PENDING_REVIEW, REJECTED, HIDDEN, SOLD, SOLD_OUT skip re-review.
- Cover photo reorder (`setCoverPhoto`) does not trigger re-review (same images, different order — lower risk).

### Admin review queue (`/admin/review`)
- Shows all `PENDING_REVIEW` listings ordered oldest-first
- Card shows thumbnail, title, seller name, price, date, "First listing" badge, AI flags list, confidence %
- Approve → ACTIVE + seller notification + clear rejectionReason; Reject → REJECTED + seller notification + reason required
- Count badge in admin sidebar and mobile nav

## Listing Snapshot at Purchase (complete — 2026-04-01)

**`OrderItem.listingSnapshot Json?`** — captured at checkout in both `/api/cart/checkout/route.ts` and `/api/cart/checkout/single/route.ts`. Contains:
```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "priceCents": 4500,
  "imageUrls": ["https://..."],
  "category": "FURNITURE",
  "tags": ["walnut", "handmade"],
  "sellerName": "...",
  "capturedAt": "2026-04-01T..."
}
```
Useful for order history display, dispute resolution, and archival even if the listing is later edited or deleted.

## Admin Pages (complete — 2026-04-01)

### `/admin/users`
Paginated user table with URL-param search (`?q=` by email or name). Shows name, email, role badge, join date, ban status (with reason and date). Ban/Unban button via `BanUserButton`. ADMIN-only access. 30 users/page.

### `/admin/audit`
Paginated audit log (30/page). Action column color-coded (BAN_USER=red, UNBAN_USER/APPROVE=green, HOLD/AI_HOLD=amber). Shows admin name/email, target type+ID, reason, timestamp. Undo button (within 24h) via `UndoActionButton`.

### `/admin/review`
Review queue for `PENDING_REVIEW` listings. Oldest-first. "First listing" badge, AI flags, confidence score. Approve/Reject via `ReviewListingButtons`. Count badge in sidebar + mobile nav. ADMIN or EMPLOYEE access.

### `/admin/reports`
Reports show reason + details inline. Each report card now includes a contextual link based on `targetType`:
- `SELLER` → "View seller →" to `/seller/[targetId]`
- `LISTING` → "View listing →" to `/listing/[targetId]`
- `MESSAGE_THREAD` → "View thread →" to `/messages/[targetId]`
- `BLOG_POST` → "View post →" to `/blog/[targetId]`
- null → no link shown

### Admin layout + mobile nav updates
- Desktop sidebar: added Review Queue (with `pendingReviewCount` badge), Users, Audit Log links
- Mobile nav: added same three tabs with badge support
- `Eye` icon used for Review Queue, `User` for Users, `Shield` for Audit Log (already imported)
- `pendingReviewCount` added to parallel `Promise.all` in layout; passed to `AdminMobileNav`

### `UserReport` schema (2026-04-13)
Added `targetType String?` and `targetId String?` to `UserReport` model. Migration: `20260413200254_add_user_report_target`. `BlockReportButton` accepts optional `targetType` and `targetId` props and includes them in the POST body. Report API route (`/api/users/[id]/report`) reads and saves both fields. Wired on:
- `seller/[id]/page.tsx` → `targetType="SELLER" targetId={seller.id}`
- `messages/[id]/page.tsx` → `targetType="MESSAGE_THREAD" targetId={id}` (conversation ID)
- `listing/[id]/page.tsx` → `targetType="LISTING" targetId={listing.id}` (added BlockReportButton to seller card, gated on `meId && !isOwnListing`)

## Metro Geography Infrastructure (complete — 2026-04-01)

Data layer for city-level SEO pages. No page routes yet — pages are built in the next session.

### `Metro` model (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- `id`, `slug` (unique, e.g. `"austin-tx"`), `name`, `state`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `radiusMiles Int @default(45)`, `isActive Boolean @default(true)`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
- **Self-relation**: `parentMetroId String?` → `Metro?` (child metros roll up to a parent major metro). A metro with no parent is a major metro.
- Back-relations on `Listing`, `CommissionRequest`, and `SellerProfile` (both `metro` and `cityMetro` variants)
- Migration: `20260401060322_add_metro_geography`

### Two-tier structure
- **Major metros** — no parent (e.g. `austin-tx`, `houston-tx`, `dallas-tx`)
- **Child metros** — point to a parent (e.g. `katy-tx → houston-tx`, `round-rock-tx → austin-tx`)
- A point matches a metro when it falls within that metro's `radiusMiles` radius (Haversine)

### Fields added
- `Listing`: `metroId String?` (major metro), `cityMetroId String?` (specific child metro)
- `CommissionRequest`: same two fields
- `SellerProfile`: same two fields
- All set automatically on create; left null if outside all metro areas or if geo-mapping fails

### Seed data (`prisma/seeds/metros.ts`)
20 Texas metros: 7 major (Austin, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Fort Worth, College Station, Waco) + 13 children. Run with:
```
npx dotenv-cli -e .env -- npx ts-node --transpile-only prisma/seeds/metros.ts
```

### `src/lib/geo-metro.ts`
- **`findNearestMetro(lat, lng)`** — checks child metros first (more specific), then majors; returns `{ cityMetro, majorMetro }` within radius
- **`mapToMetros(lat, lng)`** — **legacy function**, do not use in new code; kept for reference only. Use `findOrCreateMetro` instead.
- **`findOrCreateMetro(lat, lng)`** — **primary mapping function** for all new code: calls `findNearestMetro` first; if no metro found within radius, calls `reverseGeocode` (Nominatim, ≥1.1s throttle, US-only) to get city/state, then `prisma.metro.upsert` to auto-create a new metro at that location with slug format `city-name-xx`. Logs `[geo-metro] Auto-created metro: ${slug}` to Vercel logs. Returns `{ metroId, cityMetroId }` — always non-throwing (wrapped in try/catch at every call site).
- **`isMetroSlug(slug)`** — returns `true` if slug matches `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]+-[a-z]{2}$/`; used in dynamic routes to distinguish metro slugs from CUIDs

### `src/lib/reverse-geocode.ts`
- **`reverseGeocode(lat, lng)`** — calls Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) reverse geocoding API; `User-Agent: Grainline/1.0 (thegrainline.com)`; enforces ≥1.1s between requests (Nominatim policy); extracts city from `address.city|town|village|hamlet`; returns `{ city, state, stateCode }` or `null` on failure/non-US result
- **Throttle**: module-level `lastRequestTime` variable; `throttledFetch` adds delay if < 1100ms has elapsed since last call (Nominatim policy: max 1 req/sec)
- All 50 US state names → two-letter codes in `STATE_CODES` map; returns `null` for non-US results

### Auto-mapping on create
- **Listings** (`dashboard/listings/new/page.tsx`) — after `prisma.listing.create`, fetches seller's lat/lng, calls `findOrCreateMetro`, updates listing. Non-fatal try/catch.
- **Commission requests** (`api/commission/route.ts`) — after create, if `lat`/`lng` set (local scope requests), calls `findOrCreateMetro`. Non-fatal try/catch.
- **Seller profile settings** (`dashboard/seller/page.tsx`) — after `prisma.sellerProfile.update`, if lat/lng is set, calls `findOrCreateMetro` and updates `metroId`/`cityMetroId`. Non-fatal try/catch.

### Backfill script (`scripts/backfill-metros.ts`)
One-time script — finds all existing listings, commissions, and seller profiles with coordinates but no `metroId`. For each coordinate, uses inline `resolveMetros` first; if nothing found, calls Nominatim and auto-creates the metro. Run with:
```
npx dotenv-cli -e .env -- npx ts-node --transpile-only scripts/backfill-metros.ts
```
Result on first run: 4 sellers, 20 listings updated; 0 commissions (none had local coordinates).

### Metro slug format
`<city-name>-<two-letter-state>` — all lowercase, hyphens for spaces (e.g. `the-woodlands-tx`). `isMetroSlug()` validates this format using `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]+-[a-z]{2}$/`.

## City SEO Pages (complete — 2026-04-01)

Built on top of the metro geography infrastructure. All pages are public (middleware updated).

### Route structure and conflict resolution

| Route | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/browse/[metroSlug]` | `src/app/browse/[metroSlug]/page.tsx` | City listings grid |
| `/browse/[metroSlug]/[category]` | `src/app/browse/[metroSlug]/[category]/page.tsx` | City + category filter |
| `/commission/[param]` | `src/app/commission/[param]/page.tsx` | **Merged route** — see below |
| `/makers/[metroSlug]` | `src/app/makers/[metroSlug]/page.tsx` | City sellers directory |

**Commission route conflict resolution**: `/commission/[id]` (CUID) and `/commission/[metroSlug]` (metro slug) would be the same dynamic segment. Solution: single `[param]` route at `src/app/commission/[param]/page.tsx` that calls `isMetroSlug(param)` at the top. If true → renders metro commissions page. If false → renders existing commission detail page (original `[id]` logic). The old `src/app/commission/[id]/` directory was deleted; `MarkStatusButtons.tsx` was moved to `[param]/`.

### Query logic
- **Major metro** (no `parentMetroId`): queries by `metroId = metro.id` — captures all listings in the area including child cities
- **Child metro**: queries by `cityMetroId = metro.id` — shows only items mapped to that specific city

### generateStaticParams — content-gated
Each route only generates static params for metros that have at least 1 active listing/seller/commission. Empty metros are excluded from static generation and the sitemap. If navigated to directly, the page renders an empty-city variant with a commission CTA.

### Metadata per city page

**Browse**: `Handmade Woodworking in [City], [State] | Grainline` — description pulls live listing/seller counts

**Commission metro**: `Custom Woodworking Commissions in [City], [State] | Grainline`

**Makers**: `Woodworkers & Furniture Makers in [City], [State] | Grainline`

All have `alternates.canonical` and OpenGraph tags.

### JSON-LD structured data
- **Browse + commission metro**: `ItemList` schema with up to 10 `ListItem` entries (name, URL, image, offer price)
- **Makers**: `ItemList` of `LocalBusiness` entries with address, description, and `knowsAbout: "Handmade Woodworking"`
- **All city pages**: `BreadcrumbList` — Home → Browse/State → State → City

### Unique intro copy
- Browse with content: "Discover X handmade pieces from Y local makers in City, State. From custom furniture to kitchen accessories, connect directly with makers in the City area."
- Browse empty: "Custom woodworking in City — makers coming soon. Post a commission request…"
- Commission, Makers: similar dynamic patterns pulling live counts

### Nearby areas internal linking
- Major metro page: shows child metros that have content (e.g. Austin → Round Rock, Cedar Park…)
- Child metro page: shows siblings (same parent) + parent metro
- Only metros with active listings/sellers shown. Creates a crawlable geographic link network.

### National browse page additions
- **"Browse by city"** section added at the bottom of `/browse` — grouped by major metro with children listed under each. Only shows metros with active listings. Crawlable `<a>` links for Google discovery.

### Sitemap priorities

| Route | Priority | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| `/browse/[metroSlug]` — major metro | 0.8 | weekly |
| `/browse/[metroSlug]` — child metro | 0.6 | weekly |
| `/browse/[metroSlug]/[category]` | 0.5 | weekly |
| `/makers/[metroSlug]` | 0.6 | monthly |
| `/commission/[metroSlug]` | 0.6 | weekly |

Only metros with active listings/sellers/commissions are included. `BASE_URL` corrected from `grainline.co` → `https://thegrainline.com` across the entire sitemap.

### Internal linking (SEO crawl graph)

- **Listing detail** → links to `/browse/[metro]` ("Browse all pieces in [City]") in Details section
- **Commission detail** → links to `/commission/[metro]` ("More commissions in [City]") in the aside
- **Seller profile** → links to `/makers/[metro]` ("More makers in [City]") near the location chip
- **Nearby areas** on city pages creates a dense geographic crawl graph (major → children, child → siblings + parent)
- **National `/browse`** has "Browse by city" section at bottom with all metros grouped by major metro

### Dynamic footer

`src/app/layout.tsx` footer queries `Metro` for all `isActive` metros with at least 1 active listing; renders them as linked text under "Browse by City". Only present on pages that use the root layout (all public pages).

## UI Polish Summary (complete — 2026-04-01)

Full visual polish pass across all pages. All changes were CSS/class-only (no logic or feature changes).

### Global
- Body background: `bg-[#F7F5F0]` (warm cream) — set on `<body>` in `layout.tsx`
- Global button base: `button { border-radius: 0.375rem }` in `globals.css` (overridden by `.rounded-full` for pills)
- Horizontal scroll containers: `pb-0` — eliminates cream strip at bottom of scroll rows

### Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Removed `<Logs>` icon from "Fresh from the Workshop" heading; removed `<Heart>` icon from "Buyer Favorites" heading — clean serif text only
- Card info sections: `bg-stone-50` → `bg-white` on all horizontal scroll cards
- Section spacing: `space-y-16` → `space-y-10` on main content container (eliminates oversized gaps)
- "From Your Makers" scroll row: `pb-2` → `pb-0`
- Scroll container `bg-white` added to Fresh from the Workshop `<ul>`, Buyer Favorites `<ul>`, and From Your Makers `<ul>` — prevents page cream background from showing through gaps between cards
- **Alternating warm section backgrounds**: "Meet a Maker" and "Stories from the Workshop" `ScrollSection` wrappers get `bg-amber-50/30 rounded-xl px-4 py-6 -mx-4` for subtle warm tint (hero, stats bar, map, newsletter sections unchanged)
- Category tiles updated: TOOLS → "Home & Office" (`Box` icon), STORAGE → "Gifts" (`Gift` icon), added ART (`Palette`), OUTDOOR (`TreePine`); removed OTHER; now 8 tiles + "Browse all" (9 total); grid updated to `sm:grid-cols-9`

### Browse (`src/app/browse/page.tsx`)
- h1 "Browse": added `font-display`

### Messages inbox (`src/app/messages/page.tsx`)
- h1 "Messages": added `font-display`

- "My Listings" and "Saved Searches" h2s: added `font-display`

## ListingCard Redesign (complete — 2026-04-09)

Single-file redesign applied to `src/components/ListingCard.tsx`, propagating to all migrated call sites:
- Photo: `rounded-2xl overflow-hidden aspect-square group-hover:scale-105` — square crop, rounded, subtle zoom on hover
- No card border or bg-white background — text floats on page background
- Title: `line-clamp-1` (single line, truncated with ellipsis) — prevents height mismatches between cards in grid/scroll rows
- Single star rating: `★ 4.8 (12)` replaces five-star StarsInline on all cards
- City/state location line below price
- Status badges (Made to order / Ready to ship) removed from cards — only on listing detail page
- Seller name as plain text link (no avatar chip)
- GuildBadge: 40px right-aligned in metadata area via two-column flex layout
- FavoriteButton: no background circle — grey heart shape behind white outline for visibility, `drop-shadow` for depth on all photo backgrounds
- Browse grid gap: `gap-x-4 gap-y-8`
- scroll ul bg-white removed from homepage Fresh + Favorites containers (already absent)
- Five-star StarsInline preserved on listing detail page only

## Layout & Polish Pass (complete — 2026-04-09)

- Browse + Listing: gradient moved outside max-w constraint — now full-screen width
- All listing surfaces: max-w-6xl → max-w-7xl (1280px)
- Browse grid: xl:grid-cols-4 (4 columns on very wide screens only)
- Browse FilterSidebar: sticky top-4 self-start
- ListingCard: seller avatar removed — seller name as plain text link
- ListingCard: hover photo swap — shows second listing photo on hover when available
- ListingCard: `secondPhotoUrl?: string | null` added to `ListingCardData` type
- Homepage scroll rows: `ScrollFadeRow` component (`src/components/ScrollFadeRow.tsx`) wraps Fresh, Favorites, From Your Makers. Right edge fade always visible; left edge fade only appears after `scrollLeft > 0` via `data-scrolled` attribute. CSS in `globals.css` `.scroll-fade-edges`.
- From Your Makers: bg-white removed from scroll ul for consistency
- Browse + page.tsx photo queries: `take: 2` to enable hover swap

## Mobile Mosaic + Card Layout + Gradient Fix (2026-04-09)

- HeroMosaic: style={{ width: "200%" }} → w-max on both rows — fixes mobile showing only 3 photos
- Browse gradient: softened to from-amber-50/30 via-amber-50/10 to match header seamlessly
- ListingCard: badge moved to photo overlay bottom-left (bg-black/70 solid, green/amber text)
- ListingCard: metadata collapsed to 3 lines — title / price+rating inline / location·seller
- ListingCard: fixed nested Link bug — location+seller row is a sibling div not inside listing Link

## Message + Mobile Fixes (2026-04-10)

- seller/[id]/page.tsx: featured/all listings use w-[200px]/w-[220px] flex-none — fixes mobile card stretch with aspect-square
- ActionForm.tsx: useEffect dependency [state?.ok] → [state] — fixes repeat sends not clearing MessageComposer
- MessageComposer.tsx: actionform:ok handler explicitly resets textarea DOM value + height — fixes emoji residue after send
- ThreadMessages.tsx: 500ms fallback setTimeout after initial requestAnimationFrame scroll — fixes mobile loading at top of thread
- MessageComposer: Enter sends, Shift+Enter newline, auto-grow up to 160px max-height, resets to single row after send
- ThreadMessages: text-left inside bubbles, break-words, desktop-only card styling (mobile full-bleed), pb-8 on scroll container
- ThreadMessages: break-all (was break-words) to break mid-word on long strings; scroll-after-send uses 200ms setTimeout to wait for DOM render
- Map page: initialZoom = 3, AllSellersMap default center [-96, 38] zoom 3 (full US view)

## Listing Page + UX Polish (2026-04-10)

- listing/[id]/page.tsx: Shop Policies accordion added before SimilarItems — shows returnPolicy, shippingPolicy, customOrderPolicy; no query change (seller fully included already)
- page.tsx: Hero text changed to "Buy handmade. Buy local. Buy quality." with updated subheading
- globals.css: scroll-fade-edges updated — right fade always visible, left fade only when `data-scrolled="true"` (set by `ScrollFadeRow` component on scroll)
- src/app/about/page.tsx: About page with live stats, story sections, maker + buyer CTAs; added to isPublic middleware and footer

## Social Features (2026-04-10)

### Block/Report Users
- `Block` model + `UserReport` model added to schema; migration: `add_block_report`
- Block enforcement: `sendMessage` server action checks `Block` table before sending — returns `{ ok: false, error: "blocked" }`
- Block enforcement: follow API rejects if either user has blocked the other
- `POST/DELETE /api/users/[id]/block` — upsert/delete Block record
- `POST /api/users/[id]/report` — creates UserReport; rate limited 5/hr (`reportRatelimit`)
- `reportRatelimit` added to `src/lib/ratelimit.ts`
- `BlockReportButton` (`src/components/BlockReportButton.tsx`) — ••• menu with block/unblock + report with reason + details; wired into `seller/[id]/page.tsx` and `messages/[id]/page.tsx`; **dropdown direction fix** (2026-04-13): `triggerRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>()` on trigger, `getBoundingClientRect()` in `handleOpen()` measures position before opening, `openUpward ? "bottom-full mb-1" : "top-full mt-1"` classes applied; report label: "Report this listing" (LISTING), "Report this conversation" (MESSAGE_THREAD), "Report [name]" (default)
- `POST /api/admin/reports/[id]/resolve` — marks resolved, logs `RESOLVE_REPORT` to audit

### My Reviews
- `src/app/account/reviews/page.tsx` — buyer's review history with listing photo, stars, comment, seller reply
- Linked from `account/page.tsx` as new Section 4

### Admin Reports Queue
- `src/app/admin/reports/page.tsx` — unresolved reports with reporter/reported names, reason, resolve button; reported user name is a Link to `/admin/users?q=<email>` for quick lookup
- `ResolveReportButton` (`src/components/admin/ResolveReportButton.tsx`) + resolve API route
- Reports link added to admin sidebar + mobile nav

## Admin Capabilities (2026-04-10)

- DELETE /api/admin/reviews/[id] — hard delete review; logged as DELETE_REVIEW in AdminAuditLog
- DELETE /api/admin/listings/[id] — soft delete (status=HIDDEN); logged as REMOVE_LISTING; no migration needed
- POST /api/admin/email — ADMIN-only; rate limited 10/hr via adminEmailRatelimit; Resend email with Grainline template
- adminEmailRatelimit added to src/lib/ratelimit.ts (slidingWindow 10/1h)
- src/app/admin/reviews/page.tsx — all reviews list with delete buttons (100 most recent)
- DeleteReviewButton, DeleteListingButton, AdminEmailForm in src/components/admin/
- AdminEmailForm: expand/collapse pattern, collapses after successful send
- Admin sidebar + mobile nav updated with Reviews link

## Shared ListingCard Component (complete — refactor)

`src/components/ListingCard.tsx` — `"use client"` shared card component used across all listing grid/scroll surfaces. Zero visual changes from prior inline implementations.

### `ListingCardData` type
```ts
export type ListingCardData = {
  id, title, priceCents, currency, status, listingType, stockQuantity?,
  photoUrl, seller: { id, displayName, avatarImageUrl, guildLevel, city, state, acceptingNewOrders },
  rating?: { avg, count } | null
}
```

### Props
- `listing: ListingCardData`
- `initialSaved: boolean`
- `variant: "grid" | "scroll"` — grid: full `card-listing` with seller chip + GuildBadge + acceptingNewOrders badge; scroll: compact `w-full` card for horizontal scroll rows

### Migrated call sites (7 total)
| File | Variant | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `browse/page.tsx` | `grid` | Inside `GridCard` wrapper which provides its own ClickTracker; outer ClickTracker removed from call site |
| `page.tsx` (homepage) | `scroll` | Fresh from the Workshop + Buyer Favorites horizontal rows; ClickTracker stays at call site as `<li>` |
| `account/saved/page.tsx` | `grid` | Added `listingType`, `stockQuantity`, `guildLevel`, `city`, `state`, `acceptingNewOrders` to Prisma select |
| `seller/[id]/shop/page.tsx` | `grid` | Seller chip data from page-level `seller` object |
| `seller/[id]/page.tsx` | `grid` | Featured Work + All Listings; seller chip data from page-level `seller` object |
| `browse/[metroSlug]/page.tsx` | `grid` | Added `status`, `listingType`, `stockQuantity`, `city`, `state`, `acceptingNewOrders` to Prisma select |
| `browse/[metroSlug]/[category]/page.tsx` | `grid` | Same field additions |

### ClickTracker nesting rule
`ClickTracker` renders as a `<li>`. When the component providing the card (e.g. `GridCard` in browse) includes its own `ClickTracker`, the outer `<ClickTracker>` at the call site must be removed. For scroll-variant cards, `ClickTracker` stays at the call site and `ListingCard` renders an inner `<div>`.

## Block Filtering (complete — 2026-04-13)

Mutual block filtering applied to all public surfaces. When user A blocks user B (or is blocked by B), neither can see the other's content anywhere on the platform.

### Utility (`src/lib/blocks.ts`)
- **`getBlockedUserIdsFor(meId)`** — queries `Block` table bidirectionally, returns `Set<string>` of all user IDs that are either blocking or blocked by the given user
- **`getBlockedSellerProfileIdsFor(meId)`** — calls `getBlockedUserIdsFor`, maps user IDs to SellerProfile IDs

### Pattern rules
- Prisma: `...(list.length > 0 ? { field: { notIn: list } } : {})` — never passes `notIn: []`
- Raw SQL: skip when empty; use `!= ALL(${array})` template parameter when non-empty
- Never applied to admin surfaces or order history

### Surfaces covered (12)

| Surface | File | What changes |
|---|---|---|
| Browse | `browse/page.tsx` | `sellerId: { notIn: blockedSellerIds }` on main query; preserved through sellerIdFilters merge |
| Homepage | `page.tsx` | `fresh`, `topSaved`, `fromYourMakers` recentListings/recentPosts |
| Seller profile | `seller/[id]/page.tsx` | Returns "not available" page with "Browse other makers →" (not 404) |
| Messages inbox | `messages/page.tsx` | Post-fetch `convos.filter()` by other participant |
| Blog index | `blog/page.tsx` | `authorId: { notIn: [...] }` in `baseFilters` — applies to both GIN + standard query paths |
| Blog post | `blog/[slug]/page.tsx` | `notFound()` if post author is in blocked set |
| Feed API | `api/account/feed/route.ts` | Filters `sellerIds` from follows before all three parallel queries |
| Makers map | `map/page.tsx` | `id: { notIn: blockedSellerIds }` on sellerProfile query |
| Search suggestions | `api/search/suggestions/route.ts` | Prisma `listings` query + two conditional raw SQL paths (tagRows, fuzzyRows) |
| Metro browse | `browse/[metroSlug]/page.tsx` + `[metroSlug]/[category]/page.tsx` | `sellerId: { notIn: blockedSellerIds }` in `listingWhere` |
| Commission board | `commission/page.tsx` | Standard Prisma path: `buyerId: { notIn: [...] }`; near-me raw SQL path: post-filter `rawResults` (added `u.id AS "buyerId"` to SELECT) |
| Reviews | `ReviewsSection.tsx` + `listing/[id]/page.tsx` | Added `blockedUserIds?: string[]` prop; `reviewerId: { notIn: blockedUserIds }` on review query |
| Homepage MakersMapSection | `page.tsx` | `id: { notIn: blockedSellerIds }` on mapRows sellerProfile query |
| Homepage Stories (blog) | `page.tsx` | `authorId: { notIn: [...blockedUserIds] }` on recentBlogPosts query; added `getBlockedUserIdsFor` import |
| Listing detail | `listing/[id]/page.tsx` | Returns "not available" page (not 404) if seller user is in blocked set |
| Saved items | `account/saved/page.tsx` | `listing: { sellerId: { notIn: blockedSellerIds } }` on favorites query |

### `/account/blocked` page (complete — 2026-04-13)
- `src/app/account/blocked/page.tsx` — server component; lists all blocks WHERE `blockerId = me.id` (only blocks YOU created); shows avatar + name per row; Unblock button submits to server action
- `src/app/account/blocked/actions.ts` — `unblockUser(blockedId)` server action; verifies ownership before `deleteMany`; `revalidatePath("/account/blocked")`
- Form uses `action={unblockUser.bind(null, b.blockedId)}` pattern (no inline closure)
- Linked from `/account` page inside the My Reviews section (same card, `block` links)
- Card layout matches `/account/reviews` exactly (`card-section p-4 flex gap-4`)

### Auth pattern for server components
When auth() was positioned after the queries that need block filtering, it was moved to before those queries. The resolved `meDbId` is reused in downstream savedSet / favorites logic to eliminate redundant DB lookups.

## Bug Fixes (2026-04-13)

Seven bugs fixed across seller shop, dashboard, and blog pages. Zero TypeScript errors. Deployed.

- **Remove custom photo button did nothing** (`dashboard/profile/page.tsx`): Root cause was nested `<form>` elements — the remove button was inside `<form action={removeSellerAvatar}>` nested inside `<form action={updateSellerProfile}>`. HTML discards inner forms; the button submitted the outer form instead. Fix: extracted `RemoveAvatarButton.tsx` (`"use client"`) with `type="button"` that calls the server action directly and calls `router.refresh()` to force RSC re-render.

- **Dashboard listing cards not clickable** (`dashboard/page.tsx`): Non-draft listings (ACTIVE, HIDDEN, SOLD, SOLD_OUT, PENDING_REVIEW) had no clickable link on photo or title. Fixed by wrapping photo in `<Link href={/listing/${l.id}}>` and title text in a separate `<Link>` for non-DRAFT statuses. DRAFT listings keep only the existing "Preview →" link.

- **Shop page draft cards missing preview banner** (`seller/[id]/shop/page.tsx`, `components/ListingCard.tsx`): Added `href?: string` prop to `ListingCard`; `listingHref = href ?? /listing/${l.id}`. Shop page passes `href={/listing/${l.id}?preview=1}` for owner+DRAFT listings.

- **publishListingAction missing chargesEnabled check** (`seller/[id]/shop/actions.ts`, `ShopListingActions.tsx`): Added `chargesEnabled` guard BEFORE the try/catch in `publishListingAction` so it throws to the client. Added try/catch to the Publish button's `startTransition` handler in `ShopListingActions.tsx` — shows error message as toast (e.g. "Connect your bank account in Shop Settings to publish.").

- **SOLD listings had no way to relist** (`seller/[id]/shop/actions.ts`, `ShopListingActions.tsx`): Added `markAvailableAction` (sets ACTIVE, syncThreshold, revalidates shop + dashboard). Added "Mark available" button shown for SOLD status only.

- **HIDDEN listings showed both Publish and Unhide** (`ShopListingActions.tsx`): Rewrote per-status button logic. Final matrix: ACTIVE → Hide, Mark sold, Delete; HIDDEN → Unhide, Delete; DRAFT → Publish, Delete; PENDING_REVIEW → (nothing, Edit only); SOLD → Mark available, Delete; SOLD_OUT → Delete. Edit link always shown. Delete hidden from PENDING_REVIEW only.

- **Blog post author avatar used Clerk image only** (`blog/[slug]/page.tsx`): Added `sellerProfile: { select: { avatarImageUrl, displayName } }` to the `author` select. Updated resolution: `authorAvatar = post.author.sellerProfile?.avatarImageUrl ?? post.author.imageUrl`; `authorName = post.author.sellerProfile?.displayName ?? post.author.name ?? "Staff"`. No layout changes.

## SEO & Styling Audit Fixes (complete — 2026-04-16)

Six fixes applied across SEO gaps and card-section styling consistency. Zero TypeScript errors.

### SEO FIX 1: "More from this maker" on listing detail
- `src/app/listing/[id]/page.tsx` — added `moreFromSeller` query (up to 4 ACTIVE non-private listings from same seller, ordered by `qualityScore desc`, excluding current listing) to the existing `Promise.all` alongside rating aggregates
- New section rendered between "About this piece"/"Details"/"Shop Policies" and "You might also like" (SimilarItems): 2x4 grid of seller's other listings with rounded photo, title, price
- Creates strong internal links between a seller's listings, improving crawl depth and cross-sell

### SEO FIX 2: Blocked pages return 404 instead of thin 200
- `src/app/listing/[id]/page.tsx` — blocked-seller check now calls `notFound()` instead of rendering a thin `<main>` with "This listing is not available" (was indexable 200 with zero content)
- `src/app/seller/[id]/page.tsx` — same fix for blocked seller profiles

### SEO FIX 3: Browse category title redundancy removed
- `src/app/browse/page.tsx` `generateMetadata` — category title changed from `${label} — Handmade Woodworking` (redundant "Handmade X — Handmade Woodworking") to `Handmade ${label} | Grainline`
- Search results title changed from `Search results for "${q}"` to `${q} — Handmade Woodworking | Grainline` (adds brand, removes generic prefix)

### SEO FIX 4: Blog OG image fallback
- `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` `generateMetadata` — when no `coverImageUrl` exists, OG images now fall back to `https://thegrainline.com/og-image.jpg` instead of `undefined`
- Twitter card images also use the same fallback

### SEO FIX 5: Seller profile city browse link
- `src/app/seller/[id]/page.tsx` — added a second link below "More makers in [City]" that reads "Browse [City], [State] listings →" linking to `/browse/[metroSlug]`
- Creates bidirectional internal links between seller profiles and city browse pages

### STYLING FIX 6: card-section/card-listing migration (9 files)
Replaced raw `rounded-xl border` / `rounded-xl border bg-white` / `border border-neutral-200` with design system classes:

| File | What changed |
|---|---|
| `checkout/success/page.tsx` | Receipt section: `rounded-xl border bg-white` → `card-section` |
| `blog/[slug]/page.tsx` | Featured listing cards + related post cards: `rounded-xl border overflow-hidden hover:shadow-sm` → `card-listing` |
| `commission/[param]/page.tsx` | Empty state container: `border border-neutral-200 p-8` → `card-section p-8` |
| `account/feed/FeedClient.tsx` | Skeleton cards: `border border-neutral-200` → `card-section` |
| `dashboard/verification/page.tsx` | Eligibility checklist, application forms, metrics info boxes: 6 instances of `rounded-xl border` → `card-section` |
| `admin/broadcasts/page.tsx` | Empty state + broadcast cards: `rounded-xl border` → `card-section` |
| `admin/blog/page.tsx` | Pending comment cards + empty state: `rounded-xl border bg-white` → `card-section` |
| `admin/verification/page.tsx` | Empty states, application cards, seller rows: 7 instances of `rounded-xl border` → `card-section` |

## Listing Form + UX Fixes (2026-04-22)

### Schema additions (migration `20260422231209_add_listing_seo_fields`)
- `Listing.metaDescription String?` — custom SEO meta description (160 chars max)
- `Listing.materials String[]` — comma-separated materials list (e.g. walnut, maple, brass hardware)
- `Listing.productLengthIn Float?`, `productWidthIn Float?`, `productHeightIn Float?` — actual product dimensions in inches (separate from packaged dimensions used for shipping)

### Edit listing redirect
- `updateListing` server action now calls `redirect(/listing/${listingId})` after saving — previously stayed on the edit page

### Character counters
- `CharCounter` component updated with `required` prop and design system border styling
- New `InputCharCounter` export for single-line text inputs with character count
- Applied to: Title (100 chars), Description (2000 chars), Meta description (160 chars) on both create and edit pages

### Wider content width
- `seller/[id]/page.tsx` and `seller/[id]/shop/page.tsx`: `max-w-6xl` → `max-w-7xl`
- Homepage and browse already used `max-w-7xl`

### AI_HOLD_LISTING removed from audit log
- `logAdminAction` call with `AI_HOLD_LISTING` removed from `dashboard/listings/new/page.tsx` — AI review hold is automated and shouldn't clutter the admin audit trail

### Loading skeletons modernized
- `browse/loading.tsx`: removed `border` from skeleton cards, added `rounded-2xl` photo placeholders, wider `max-w-7xl`, 4-column grid
- `listing/[id]/loading.tsx`: same treatment

### Edit listing page styling
- All inputs: `border border-neutral-200 rounded-md` (was `border rounded`)
- Labels: `text-sm font-medium text-neutral-700` (was `text-sm`)
- Listing type and packaged dims sections: `card-section p-4` (was `border rounded p-3`)

### TagsInput styling
- Border: `border border-neutral-200` (was bare `border`)

### Notification preferences split
- `/account/settings` now shows ONLY buyer-relevant preferences (From Makers You Follow, Orders & Cases, buyer email prefs)
- Seller notification preferences moved to `/dashboard/seller` under new "Shop Notifications" section with in-app and email subsections
- Link from `/account/settings` to `/dashboard/seller` for sellers

### AI alt text backfill fix
- `ai-review.ts`: both the no-API-key early return and the catch block now explicitly return `altTexts: []` — prevents `undefined` from silently skipping alt text backfill

### Edit page photo management (`EditPhotoGrid` component)
- New `src/components/EditPhotoGrid.tsx` — "use client" component with:
  - HTML5 drag-and-drop reorder (drag photos between positions)
  - Arrow button reorder (fallback for mobile/accessibility)
  - Inline alt text editing per photo with "Save alt texts" button
  - Delete photos with X button
  - "Make cover" to move any photo to first position
  - Toast notifications for all actions
- Replaced the old server-rendered photo grid + separate `ActionForm` for alt texts
- Old server actions `deletePhoto`, `saveAltTexts`, `setCoverPhoto` replaced with `reorderPhotos`, `deletePhotoAction`, `saveAltTextsAction`

### Alt text input styling (both create + edit)
- Placeholder: "Describe this image (e.g. 'Hand-carved walnut dining table')"
- Helper text: "Alt text improves visibility in Google Image Search"
- Consistent styling across `PhotoManager` and `EditPhotoGrid`

### Materials and dimensions on listing detail
- Materials shown in Details table when present (comma-separated)
- Product dimensions shown as `L × W × H` in inches when present
- `generateMetadata` uses `metaDescription` when available, falls back to `description.slice(0, 160)`

## Homepage Styling Pass (2026-04-22)

### Map section
- Removed double-border (homepage wrapper + MakersMapSection inner border)
- `MakersMapSection.tsx`: `rounded-3xl border bg-white` → `rounded-2xl bg-stone-50` (warm, no border)
- "Use my location" button: `bg-[#2C1F1A] hover:bg-[#3A2A24]` (espresso brand color, was amber/orange)
- "Open Makers Map" button: `border-neutral-300 bg-white hover:bg-neutral-50`

### Categories
- Tiles: `bg-amber-50 hover:bg-amber-100` with `text-amber-700` icons, no borders
- "Browse all" tile: same amber styling with arrow icon

### Meet a Maker
- Outer card: `bg-stone-50 rounded-2xl` (was `bg-white shadow-sm border`)
- Featured listings: `rounded-xl` photos floating on warm background (was `card-listing` with borders)
- Tagline: added `border-l-2 border-amber-300 pl-3` accent for visual emphasis
- "Visit Their Workshop" button: espresso `bg-[#2C1F1A]` (matches hero)

## Wider Layout Pass (2026-04-22/23)

All major public-facing and dashboard pages widened to `max-w-[1600px]` (was `max-w-7xl`/1280px):
- Homepage (all content sections below hero)
- Browse (both main and no-results variants, metro browse sections)
- Listing detail
- Seller profile + seller shop
- Blog index
- Commission room
- Makers map pages
- Dashboard (home, analytics, sales, inventory, blog)
- Account (home, orders, saved items)
- Admin (reports, reviews)

Pages intentionally kept narrow: messages, checkout, cart, blog post detail, about, terms/privacy, profile editing, blog writing, onboarding.

## Admin PIN Gate (2026-04-23)

Session-scoped PIN verification for all admin pages. Free alternative to Clerk Pro 2FA.

### Components
- **`AdminPinGate`** (`src/components/AdminPinGate.tsx`) — `"use client"` wrapper around admin layout; shows PIN input before any admin content renders; session-scoped via `sessionStorage` (persists in tab, clears on close); client-side lockout after 5 failed attempts; Enter key submits
- **`/api/admin/verify-pin`** (`src/app/api/admin/verify-pin/route.ts`) — POST route; ADMIN role required; rate limited 5 attempts per 15 minutes via `safeRateLimit`; constant-time PIN comparison (prevents timing attacks); returns 401 for incorrect PIN, 429 for rate limit

### Wiring
- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` wraps `{children}` in `<AdminPinGate>` after existing role check
- If `ADMIN_PIN` env var is not set, access is allowed (dev mode / not configured)

### Security layers (combined, all free)
1. Clerk auth (session cookies, CSRF protection)
2. Clerk authenticator app 2FA (TOTP — free tier, enable in Clerk Dashboard → Multi-factor)
3. ADMIN role check in admin layout (DB query)
4. PIN gate with rate limiting (5 attempts / 15 min)
5. Client-side lockout after 5 failures
6. Session-scoped (new tab = new PIN entry)

### ENV required
`ADMIN_PIN` — 6-digit numeric PIN. Set in Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables (all environments).

## AI Alt Text Improvements (2026-04-22/23)

### `generateAltText` function (`src/lib/ai-review.ts`)
New lightweight export for generating alt text for individual images. Uses GPT-4o-mini with a single image at `detail: "low"`. Cost: ~$0.00003/image (vs ~$0.0006 for full review with 4 images). Returns a 10-20 word description or `null` on error.

### Alt text on edit page photo upload
`POST /api/listings/[id]/photos` now calls `generateAltText()` for each newly uploaded photo that has no alt text. Runs after photo creation, before page revalidation. Non-fatal on error.

### Alt text on create listing
Full AI review (`reviewListingWithAI`) returns `altTexts[]` for all images. Prompt strengthened: "You MUST generate an altTexts array" with explicit example. Both error paths now return `altTexts: []`. Console logging added: `[ai-review]` shows approved/flags/altTexts count, `[ai-alt-text]` shows backfill count per listing.

### Alt text UX — popup modal
Both `PhotoManager` (create) and `EditPhotoGrid` (edit) now use a popup modal for alt text instead of inline input:
- "Alt" button on each photo card (shows "Alt ✓" when text exists)
- Click opens a centered modal with image preview, textarea, and helper text
- Helper text: "If left blank, AI will generate alt text automatically and you can see it on the edit page."
- Backdrop click or "Done" button closes

## Drag-and-Drop Fix (2026-04-23)

Both `PhotoManager` and `EditPhotoGrid` drag handlers rewritten:
- `e.dataTransfer.effectAllowed = "move"` + `dropEffect = "move"` — tells browser this is a move operation
- `e.dataTransfer.setDragImage(img, 50, 50)` — drag ghost shows only the photo thumbnail, not the entire card with buttons
- `e.preventDefault()` in `handleDrop` — prevents browser from navigating to dragged content
- `select-none` on `<li>` — prevents text selection during drag
- `draggable={false}` on child `<div>` elements — prevents child elements from being independently draggable (was causing "connected to text below" bug)
- `handleDragStart` and `handleDrop` capture `from`/`to` into local variables before nulling refs — prevents race condition

## ListingTypeFields Redesign (2026-04-22)

`src/components/ListingTypeFields.tsx` fully rewritten:
- Radio buttons replaced with card-style toggle buttons (`border-neutral-900 bg-neutral-50` when selected, `border-neutral-200` when not)
- Hidden `<input name="listingType">` carries the value (radio inputs removed)
- Category select: `border-neutral-200 rounded-md`
- All inputs: `border-neutral-200 rounded-md text-sm`
- Labels: `text-neutral-700`

## Profanity Filter Expansion (2026-04-23)

`containsProfanity()` from `src/lib/profanity.ts` now applied to 7 routes (was 4):

| Route | Field | Added |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/reviews` | comment | Existing |
| `POST /api/reviews/[id]/reply` | reply text | Existing |
| `POST /api/commission` | title + description | Existing |
| `POST /api/blog/[slug]/comments` | body | Existing |
| `dashboard/blog/new createBlogPost` | title + excerpt + body | **New** |
| `messages/[id] sendMessage` | body | **New** |
| `POST /api/seller/broadcast` | message | **New** |

All checks are log-only (`console.error("[PROFANITY]")`) — they don't block submission.

## Styling Audit (2026-04-22/23)

### LocationPicker (`src/components/LocationPicker.tsx`)
- Search input: `border border-neutral-200 rounded-md text-sm`
- Search button: `border border-neutral-200 rounded-md hover:bg-neutral-50`
- Map container: `border border-neutral-200` (was bare `border` = black)
- Lat/lng readonly inputs: `border border-neutral-200 rounded-md text-sm`

### MapCard (`src/components/MapCard.tsx`)
- Default className: `border border-neutral-200` (was bare `border` = black outline)

### Seller settings pickup location label
- `block text-sm mb-2` → `block text-sm font-medium text-neutral-700 mb-2`

### Loading skeletons (`browse/loading.tsx`, `listing/[id]/loading.tsx`)
- No borders on skeleton cards — `rounded-2xl bg-neutral-200` photo placeholders
- `max-w-[1600px]` width matching live pages

## Listing Variants (2026-04-23)

Full variant system allowing sellers to add custom option groups (like Etsy "Variations").

### Schema (migration `20260423_add_listing_variants`)
- **`ListingVariantGroup`** — `id`, `listingId` → `Listing` (cascade), `name` (seller-defined, e.g. "Size", "Wood Type"), `sortOrder`; `@@index([listingId, sortOrder])`
- **`ListingVariantOption`** — `id`, `groupId` → `ListingVariantGroup` (cascade), `label` (seller-defined, e.g. "Large", "Walnut"), `priceAdjustCents Int @default(0)` (positive or negative), `sortOrder`, `inStock Boolean @default(true)`; `@@index([groupId, sortOrder])`
- **`Listing`**: `variantGroups ListingVariantGroup[]` back-relation
- **`CartItem`**: `selectedVariantOptionIds String[] @default([])`, `variantKey String @default("")`; unique constraint changed from `@@unique([cartId, listingId])` to `@@unique([cartId, listingId, variantKey])` — allows same listing with different variant selections as separate cart items
- **`OrderItem`**: `selectedVariants Json?` — snapshot of `[{ groupName, optionLabel, priceAdjustCents }]` preserved even if seller changes variants later

### Limits
- **3 groups max** per listing (e.g. Size + Wood Type + Finish)
- **10 options max** per group
- Group name: 50 chars max
- Option label: 50 chars max
- Price adjustment: any integer (positive = surcharge, negative = discount, 0 = no change)

### Components
- **`VariantEditor`** (`src/components/VariantEditor.tsx`) — `"use client"` form component for create/edit pages; manages groups + options in local state; card-section per group; "Add variant group" button (max 3); per-option: label input, price adjustment ($), in-stock checkbox, remove button; serializes to hidden `variantGroupsJson` input
- **`VariantSelector`** (`src/components/VariantSelector.tsx`) — `"use client"` buyer-facing pill selector; per-group row of option buttons (selected = `border-neutral-900 bg-neutral-900 text-white`, out-of-stock = strikethrough + disabled); shows price adjustment inline (e.g. "+$50.00"); fires `onSelectionChange(ids, totalPriceCents)`
- **`ListingPurchasePanel`** (`src/components/ListingPurchasePanel.tsx`) — `"use client"` wrapper for listing detail page; manages variant selection state; displays live price (base + adjustments, shows strikethrough base when adjusted); render prop pattern passes `{ totalPriceCents, selectedOptionIds, allVariantsSelected }` to children (buy buttons)

### Create listing flow
- `VariantEditor` rendered in card-section on create page
- `createListing` server action reads `variantGroupsJson`, validates (3 groups max, 10 options max, sanitized text), creates groups + options via nested `prisma.listing.create({ data: { variantGroups: { create: [...] } } })`

### Edit listing flow
- `VariantEditor` pre-populated with `initialGroups` from listing query (includes `variantGroups → options`)
- `updateListing` server action deletes all existing groups (cascade deletes options) then recreates from form data

### Listing detail page
- `ListingPurchasePanel` wraps price + variant selector + buy buttons
- Price updates live as buyer selects options
- `BuyNowButton` + `AddToCartButton` accept `selectedVariantOptionIds` and `variantRequired` props
- Both buttons gate on `allVariantsSelected` — show alert if variants exist but not all selected

### Cart
- `POST /api/cart/add` accepts `selectedVariantOptionIds[]`; validates each option exists and is in stock; calculates adjusted price; uses `variantKey` (sorted option IDs joined by comma) for unique constraint
- `POST /api/cart/update` rewritten to use `cartItemId` (supports multiple cart items for same listing with different variants); falls back to `listingId` for backward compat
- `GET /api/cart` returns `variantLabels[]` per item (resolved from option IDs to "Group: Label" strings)
- Cart page shows variant labels below item title

### Checkout
- `POST /api/cart/checkout/single` accepts `selectedVariantOptionIds[]`; calculates variant-adjusted `unitPriceCents`; appends variant labels to Stripe product name (e.g. "Walnut Table (Large, Dark Stain)"); stores `selectedVariants` JSON in session metadata
- Checkout-seller route: variant price is already correct in `CartItem.priceCents` (snapshotted at add-to-cart time with adjustments included)

### Webhook
- Cart path: resolves `it.selectedVariantOptionIds` against `it.listing.variantGroups → options` to build `selectedVariants` snapshot on OrderItem
- Single (buy-now) path: parses `selectedVariants` from Stripe session metadata onto OrderItem

### Order display
- Buyer order detail (`dashboard/orders/[id]`): shows "Group: Option · Group: Option" below item title when `selectedVariants` exists
- Seller order detail (`dashboard/sales/[orderId]`): same display

### Performance impact
- 3 groups × 10 options = 30 rows max per listing. Loaded via `include: { variantGroups: { include: { options: true } } }` — adds <1ms to queries
- Cart item price includes variant adjustment — no recalculation needed at checkout
- `variantKey` index enables fast upsert on add-to-cart

### Variant bug fixes (2026-04-23)
- **Seller checkout price fix** — `checkout-seller/route.ts` was using `listing.priceCents` (base price) instead of `cartItem.priceCents` (variant-adjusted price) for both Stripe `unit_amount` and `itemsSubtotalCents`. Fixed to use `i.priceCents`. Also added variant labels to Stripe product name and `variantGroups` to cart query include.
- **Negative price floor** — `cart/add` and `checkout/single` now reject variant-adjusted prices below $0.01. Prevents negative totals from large negative adjustments.
- **Stripe metadata size limit** — `selectedVariants` JSON in Stripe session metadata truncated to 500 bytes (Stripe's per-value limit). Group names and option labels truncated to 20 chars each if the full JSON exceeds 500 bytes.
- **CRITICAL: ListingPurchasePanel render prop crash** — `ListingPurchasePanel` used a render prop `children: (ctx) => ReactNode` which is a function. Next.js server components cannot pass functions to client components. Crashed ALL listing detail pages with "Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components." Fix: rewrote as self-contained client component with 20+ serializable props (strings, numbers, booleans). Renders price, variant selector, stock status, buy buttons, gift wrapping internally. Removed unused imports from listing page (BuyNowButton, AddToCartButton, NotifyMeButton, Gift).
- **VariantEditor NaN fix** — `parseFloat` of invalid input in price adjustment field could produce `NaN`. Added `isNaN()` guard, defaults to 0.

### Architecture lesson learned
**Never use render props (children-as-function) in Next.js server components.** Functions cannot cross the server/client serialization boundary. Use self-contained client components with serializable props instead. If a client component needs server-computed data, pass it as props — don't wrap server JSX in a client render prop.

## Security + Financial Audit Fixes (2026-04-23)

### Review fulfillment gate
- `POST /api/reviews` now requires `fulfillmentStatus IN (DELIVERED, PICKED_UP)` on the order. Prevents reviews before the item arrives.

### Double-refund guard
- `POST /api/cases/[id]/resolve` checks `order.sellerRefundId` before issuing Stripe refund. Returns 400 if seller already refunded. Prevents seller refund + admin case resolve double-dip.

### Case creation blocks refunded orders
- `POST /api/cases` checks `order.sellerRefundId`. Returns 400 if refund already issued. Prevents opening cases on already-refunded orders.

### Photo URL R2 origin validation
- `POST /api/listings/[id]/photos` Zod schema: `z.string().url().refine(u => u.startsWith(R2_ORIGIN))`. Blocks SSRF via arbitrary URLs forwarded to OpenAI's image fetcher. Uses `CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL` env var.

### Audit logging additions
- **Case resolve**: `logAdminAction({ action: "RESOLVE_CASE" })` with resolution type + refund amount
- **Admin email**: `logAdminAction({ action: "SEND_EMAIL" })` with recipient + subject

### sendMessage rate limit
- `sendMessage` server action in `messages/[id]/page.tsx` now uses `messageRatelimit` (30/60s). Prevents message spam.

### Stripe processing fee passed to seller
- Both `checkout-seller` and `checkout/single` now deduct estimated Stripe fee (2.9% + 30¢) from `transfer_data.amount`
- Formula: `sellerTransferAmount = preTaxTotal - platformFee - estimatedStripeFee`
- `estimatedStripeFee = Math.round(preTaxTotal * 0.029 + 30)`
- `Math.max(1)` floor prevents negative/zero transfers
- Platform no longer absorbs the ~3% Stripe processing fee
- Note: estimate is on pre-tax total (slightly underestimates since Stripe charges on post-tax). Difference is negligible and in platform's favor.

## Audit Hardening Pass (2026-04-23)

### Blog post rate limit
- `blogCreateRatelimit` in `src/lib/ratelimit.ts`: 3 posts per 24h per author, sliding window
- Wired in `dashboard/blog/new/page.tsx` `createBlogPost` server action

### AI duplicate title normalization
- `normalizeTitle()` in `ai-review.ts`: lowercase, strip punctuation/emoji, collapse whitespace
- "Walnut Bowl." and "walnut bowl" now match as duplicates
- Uses `findMany` + JS filter (was `prisma.count` with `mode: 'insensitive'` which couldn't normalize punctuation)

### Fulfillment method guard
- `api/orders/[id]/fulfillment/route.ts`: blocks `ready_for_pickup` and `picked_up` actions when `fulfillmentMethod === "SHIPPING"`
- Prevents shipping orders from being incorrectly marked as pickup

### Case auto-close cron
- **`GET /api/cron/case-auto-close`** — daily at 7am UTC (`vercel.json`)
- PENDING_CLOSE cases older than 7 days → RESOLVED (DISMISSED)
- OPEN cases where `sellerRespondBy` passed 14+ days ago → UNDER_REVIEW (escalated for admin)
- CRON_SECRET auth (same pattern as other crons)

### Seller refund notification
- `api/orders/[id]/refund/route.ts`: notification title changed from "Refund issued" to "Refund from maker" — distinguishes from admin case resolution notifications

### Image URL R2 origin enforcement
- `api/seller/broadcast/route.ts`: `imageUrl` Zod refine checks `startsWith(CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL)`
- `api/reviews/route.ts`: `photoUrls` array elements validated against R2 origin
- `api/listings/[id]/photos/route.ts`: already done in previous commit

### AI alt text sanitization
- `ai-review.ts` `generateAltText()`: strips HTML tags from AI response (`replace(/<[^>]*>/g, "")`)
- `dashboard/listings/new/page.tsx` alt text backfill: applies `sanitizeText()` before saving

### Private listing cart guard
- `api/cart/add/route.ts`: blocks `isPrivate && reservedForUserId !== me.id` — private/custom listings can only be added by the reserved buyer

### MADE_TO_ORDER quantity cap
- `api/cart/add/route.ts`: `listingType === "MADE_TO_ORDER" && quantity > 1` → 400 error. Made-to-order items limited to 1 per add-to-cart (seller makes each one individually)

## Final Audit Cleanup (2026-04-23)

### Mass-report detection
- Admin reports page (`admin/reports/page.tsx`): "Top reporters (last 30 days)" section shown when any user has 3+ reports
- `prisma.userReport.groupBy` by reporterId with count, top 5
- Color-coded badges: 10+ reports red, 5+ amber, 3+ neutral

### YouTube shorts/embed regex
- `blog/[slug]/page.tsx` `extractVideoId()`: regex updated to support `/shorts/`, `/embed/`, `/v/` paths (was only `/watch?v=` and `youtu.be/`). Vimeo also supports `/video/` prefix.

### Carrier preferred filter — exact match
- `api/shipping/quote/route.ts`: changed from `carrier.includes(pc)` (substring) to `carrier === pc || carrier.startsWith(pc + " ")` (exact match with space-delimited service name). Prevents theoretical false positives.

### Admin undo race — atomic lock
- `src/lib/audit.ts` `undoAdminAction()`: `updateMany({ where: { id, undone: false } })` as atomic lock at function start. If the update affects 0 rows, throws "Already undone (concurrent request)". Removed duplicate `update` call that was setting the same fields after the undo action.

### Items assessed as not bugs
- **SearchBar race**: already calls `setOpen(false)` before `router.push` on both Enter and form submit. Not a bug.
- **Quality score totalOrders**: already filters `WHERE il.status = 'ACTIVE' AND il."isPrivate" = false`. Not a bug.
- **Cart reservation DoS**: `checkoutRatelimit` (10/60s per user) + Cloudflare DDoS protection + 31-min session expiry provides adequate defense. Multi-account coordinated attacks require Cloudflare WAF ($20/mo) — not worth it pre-launch.

## Comprehensive Audit Fix Pass (2026-04-23)

17 fixes across critical, week-1, and low-priority categories. Zero TypeScript errors.

### Critical fixes (1-6)

**1. Webhook variant collision** — `paidItemMap` in `stripe/webhook/route.ts` changed from `Map<string, {qty,price}>` to `Map<string, {qty,price}[]>`. Multiple variants of the same listing now create separate entries. OrderItem creation uses `.shift()` to match cart items to Stripe line items in order.

**2. Stock leak on variant validation** — `checkout/single/route.ts`: variant price calculation + group validation + inStock checks moved BEFORE stock reservation. Previously: reserve stock → validate variants → return 400 (stock never restored). Now: validate variants → reserve stock → create Stripe session. Follows the documented invariant "All return-400 paths must be above stock reservation."

**3. Listing hard delete → soft delete** — Both `dashboard/page.tsx` `deleteListing` and `seller/[id]/shop/actions.ts` `deleteListingAction` changed from `prisma.listing.delete()` to `prisma.listing.update({ status: HIDDEN, isPrivate: true })`. Preserves OrderItem references and order history (7-year retention requirement).

**4. Case resolve sets Order.sellerRefundId** — `cases/[id]/resolve/route.ts` transaction now writes `sellerRefundId` and `sellerRefundAmountCents` to Order when a refund is issued. Prevents seller from issuing a duplicate refund via the separate refund API (which only checks `Order.sellerRefundId`).

**5. Variant validation in checkout/single** — Server-side validation matching `cart/add` logic: requires exactly one option per variant group, checks `inStock` per option, rejects invalid option IDs. Prevents client-side bypass of variant requirements.

**6. publishListingAction fail closed** — `seller/[id]/shop/actions.ts` catch block changed from `status: "ACTIVE"` to `status: "PENDING_REVIEW"`. AI review errors now send listings to admin queue instead of publishing them.

### Week-1 fixes (7-12)

**7. MTO quantity cap on upsert** — `cart/add/route.ts` upsert update uses `{ quantity: 1 }` for MADE_TO_ORDER listings (was `{ increment: quantity }`). Prevents accumulation past 1 via repeated add-to-cart.

**8. Cart UI sends cartItemId** — `cart/page.tsx` `setQuantity` and remove buttons now use `item.id` (cartItemId) instead of `item.listing.id` (listingId). Fixes wrong-row updates when multiple variants of the same listing are in cart.

**9. Custom-order block check** — `api/messages/custom-order-request/route.ts` now queries `Block` table before sending. Blocked users can't send custom order requests.

**10. Upload presign rate limit** — `api/upload/presign/route.ts` now rate-limited to 30 uploads per 10 minutes per user. Prevents R2 bucket abuse.

**11. Metadata priceCents fix** — `checkout/single` Stripe session metadata now stores `unitPriceCents` (variant-adjusted) instead of `listing.priceCents` (base). Webhook reads from Stripe line items anyway, but metadata now matches.

**12. Banned user check in ensureUserByClerkId** — `src/lib/ensureUser.ts` `ensureUserByClerkId` now throws on `banned=true`, matching `ensureUser` behavior. Closes the gap where banned users with active sessions could call checkout/cart APIs.

### Low-priority fixes (13-17)

**13. R2 origin on create listing** — `dashboard/listings/new/page.tsx` filters `imageUrls` by `CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL` prefix after parsing. Blocks injection of non-R2 URLs via crafted form POST.

**14. Soft-delete state machine** — `unhideListingAction` blocks unhiding of soft-deleted listings (`isPrivate: true` + `HIDDEN` status). Sellers can't resurrect deleted listings via the unhide button.

**15. Admin PIN httpOnly cookie** — `api/admin/verify-pin/route.ts` now sets a 4-hour `httpOnly`, `secure`, `sameSite: strict` cookie on successful PIN verification. Provides server-side enforcement beyond the client-side sessionStorage check.

**16. ESLint config** — Added `.claude/**`, `prisma/seeds/**`, `scripts/**` to ignores. Stops lint from scanning worktrees and build-only scripts.

**17. CI lint step** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now runs `npx next lint` (continue-on-error) after tsc. Catches lint issues in PRs.

## Opus 4.7 Audit Compliance Pass (2026-04-24)

### CAN-SPAM compliance
- **`/unsubscribe` route** — `src/app/unsubscribe/page.tsx`: redirects signed-in users to `/account/settings`, shows sign-in prompt for signed-out. Added to `isPublic` in middleware. Fixes the 404 that every email footer linked to.
- **Physical mailing address** in email footer: "5900 Balcones Drive STE 100, Austin, TX 78731" — required by CAN-SPAM §316.5(c)(1).
- **`List-Unsubscribe` + `List-Unsubscribe-Post` headers** on all outbound emails via Resend `headers` option. Gmail/Yahoo bulk-sender rule compliance (Feb 2024).

### Data retention (Order cascade fix)
- **`Order.buyerId` changed from `String` to `String?`** with `onDelete: SetNull` (was `Cascade`). Deleting a User no longer cascades-deletes their Orders. Tax/IRS 7-year retention preserved.
- Migration: `20260424_add_performance_indexes_v2` — drops NOT NULL, recreates FK with SET NULL.
- 9 files updated with optional chaining (`order.buyer?.name`) and null guards. Display shows "Deleted user" fallback.

### Stripe webhook observability
- `Sentry.captureException` added to main error handler + signature verification failure in `stripe/webhook/route.ts`. Webhook errors now appear in Sentry dashboard.

### Performance indexes (same migration)
- `Listing.priceCents` — browse price-sort queries
- `Message(conversationId, createdAt)` — compound index for thread loading
- `Review(listingId, createdAt)` — compound index for review sort
- `Order.stripePaymentIntentId` — unique index for webhook/refund lookups

### Accessibility
- **Skip-to-content link** in `layout.tsx`: `sr-only` by default, visible on keyboard focus (`focus:not-sr-only`). Points to `#main-content` wrapper.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion`** in `globals.css`: all animations disabled (`animation: none !important`), all transitions set to `0.01ms` duration. Covers hero mosaic scroll, slide-in, slide-up, pulse skeletons.

### Remaining items from Opus 4.7 audit (not yet implemented)
- **Clickwrap on sign-up** — requires attorney decision on browsewrap vs clickwrap
- **Age gate checkbox** — requires attorney scope (COPPA)
- **Account deletion flow** — needs cascade-aware deletion logic + Clerk user.deleted webhook
- **EXIF stripping from uploads** — needs R2 worker or sharp in presign route
- **OpenAI image sharing disclosure** — Privacy Policy text change
- **Money transmitter licensing** — attorney sign-off on Stripe Connect exemption
- **INFORM Consumers Act** — attorney scope for high-volume seller disclosures
- ~~**Accessibility statement page**~~ — DONE (`/accessibility` page deployed)
- **Bounce/complaint webhook from Resend** — configure in Resend dashboard, not code
- ~~**Deep health check**~~ — DONE (`/api/health` checks DB + Redis, returns 503 on failure)
- **Toast system replacing alert()** — ~20 calls across components
- **autoComplete attributes on forms** — profile, onboarding, commission, checkout
- **Webhook fire-and-forget patterns** — replace with waitUntil() or outbox

### Additional fixes from Opus 4.7 audit (2026-04-24)

**Observability:**
- All 4 cron routes now have `Sentry.captureException` on errors (guild-metrics, guild-member-check, quality-score, case-auto-close)
- `quality-score` + `case-auto-close` crons: added `maxDuration` (300s and 60s)
- `/api/health`: deep check with `SELECT 1` (DB) + `redis.ping()` (Upstash), returns 503 on failure
- Email send errors: `Sentry.captureException` with source tag + recipient metadata

**Security:**
- Commission reference image URLs: R2 origin validation
- Block action deletes reciprocal Follow rows (both directions) — prevents orphaned follower counts

**SEO:**
- Sitemap listings: filtered by `seller.chargesEnabled + vacationMode:false + user.banned:false`
- Sitemap sellers: filtered by `chargesEnabled + vacationMode:false + banned:false + has active listings`

**Email:**
- `shouldSendEmail`: checks `user.banned` — banned users don't receive non-transactional emails

**Compliance:**
- `/accessibility` page: WCAG 2.1 AA statement with known limitations + feedback channel. In footer + public middleware.

**Financial:**
- Sub-$1 payout block: both checkout routes reject orders where `preTaxTotal - fees < $1` (100 cents)
- Label purchase: blocked on refunded orders (`sellerRefundId` check) and pickup orders (`fulfillmentMethod` check)

**Schema:**
- Migration timestamp fixed: `20260423_` → `20260423000000_` for proper lexicographic ordering

### Remaining items requiring attorney/business decisions

## Pending Tasks

### Code Change Safety Rules
- NEVER remove or modify existing functionality unless explicitly told to
- Before editing any file, read the ENTIRE file first — not just the section you're changing
- After making changes to a file, verify that ALL existing features in that file still work (event handlers, API calls, JSX elements)
- If you're adding a new component or feature to a file, do NOT delete or restructure existing code in that file
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` after every file change, not just at the end
- When replacing a component (e.g., UserButton → UserDropdown), verify ALL functionality of the old component is preserved in the new one

**TypeScript: zero `tsc --noEmit` errors** (maintained as of 2026-04-01)

### Immediate / deploy blockers

1. **CSP enforcement** — ✅ **Complete (2026-04-02)** — enforced; `clerk.thegrainline.com` added to `script-src-elem`, header changed to `Content-Security-Policy`
2. **Clerk webhook production setup** — add `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to Vercel; register `https://thegrainline.com/api/clerk/webhook` in Clerk Dashboard → Production → Webhooks (events: `user.created`, `user.updated`)
3. **Stripe live mode webhook** — register after identity verification clears; update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel with live mode signing secret

### QA / pre-launch

4. **OWASP ZAP scan** — run against preview deployment before go-live
5. **End-to-end checkout testing** — 10 purchases in Stripe test mode covering: single item, multi-item cart, gift wrapping, made-to-order, pickup, custom order flow
6. **Rotate Neon database password** — credentials were visible in terminal output; rotate in Neon dashboard + update Vercel env vars
7. **Add noindex to dev data** — add `robots: { index: false }` to test listings / seller profiles before Google indexes fake data

### Platform features

8. **Wax seal stamp** (Guild Master exclusive, post-launch) — `guildStampStyle String?` on `SellerProfile`; 4 styles (serif/block/script/ornate); monogram + `logo-mark.svg` — defer until post-launch

### Legal / business

- **Rotate Neon database password** — credentials were visible in terminal output; rotate in Neon dashboard + update Vercel env vars **(LAUNCH BLOCKER)**
- **Attorney review** of Terms / Privacy — budget $1,500–$3,000; bring 5-page pre-launch checklist + 196-item attorney discussion list **(LAUNCH BLOCKER)**
- **EIN** ✅ obtained
- **Business bank account** ✅ opened
- **Business address** ✅ — Registered Agents Inc., 5900 Balcones Drive STE 100, Austin, TX 78731
- **DMCA agent registration** ✅ — DMCA-1071504, registered 2026-04-14
- **Texas marketplace facilitator registration** — required before collecting sales tax **(LAUNCH BLOCKER)**
- **Operating agreement** — create at attorney meeting **(LAUNCH BLOCKER)**
- **Clickwrap implementation** — build checkbox before account creation; attorney decides if required for launch
- **Trademark Class 035** filing — ~$350; clearance search first (conflict risk with "Grainline Studio")
- **Business insurance** — general liability ($30–60/mo) + cyber liability + marketplace product liability
- Fix Terms 6.3 redundant sentence — delete "Payout timing is governed by Stripe's standard payout schedule." *(fixed in c7bde34)*
- Fix Privacy Section 10 duplicate paragraph — delete "By using the Platform, you consent..." paragraph *(fixed in c7bde34)*
- Clean up both TOCs — remove inline subsection references, show main section titles only *(fixed in c7bde34)*
- Resolve duplicate Feedback clause — 11.6 vs 33.11; attorney decides which to keep

### SEO

17. **Google Search Console** — verify domain ownership, submit `https://thegrainline.com/sitemap.xml`
18. **`metadataBase`** ✅ corrected to `https://thegrainline.com` in `layout.tsx`

### Process

**Every Claude Code session must update CLAUDE.md at the end** — add or update sections for all features built, all bugs fixed, all schema/API/UI changes made. Keep CLAUDE.md as the authoritative reference for the current state of the codebase.

## Security Hardening (complete — 2026-03-31)

### Rate limiting — 15 routes total

All limiters live in `src/lib/ratelimit.ts` (Upstash Redis sliding-window). All 429 responses use `rateLimitResponse(reset, message)` helper — returns human-readable retry time ("a moment" / "N minutes" / "N hours" / "tomorrow at HH:MM AM") + `Retry-After` + `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers.

| Limiter | Key | Limit | Applied to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `searchRatelimit` | IP | 30 / 10 s | `GET /api/search/suggestions` |
| `viewRatelimit` | IP | 20 / 60 s | `POST /api/listings/[id]/view` |
| `clickRatelimit` | IP | 20 / 60 s | `POST /api/listings/[id]/click` |
| `reviewRatelimit` | userId | 5 / 60 s | `POST /api/reviews` |
| `checkoutRatelimit` | userId | 10 / 60 s | `POST /api/cart/checkout`, `checkout/single` |
| `messageRatelimit` | userId | 30 / 60 s | `GET /api/messages/[id]/stream` |
| `followRatelimit` | userId | 50 / 60 min | `POST/DELETE /api/follow/[sellerId]` |
| `saveRatelimit` | userId | 100 / 60 min | `POST /api/favorites` |
| `blogSaveRatelimit` | userId | 100 / 60 min | `POST/DELETE /api/blog/[slug]/save` |
| `commissionInterestRatelimit` | userId | 20 / 24 h | `POST /api/commission/[id]/interest` |
| `commissionCreateRatelimit` | userId | 5 / 24 h | `POST /api/commission` |
| `listingCreateRatelimit` | userId | 20 / 24 h | `createListing` server action |
| `profileViewRatelimit` | `${ip}:${listingId}` | 1 / 24 h | `POST /api/listings/[id]/view` (silent drop — no 429 returned) |
| `broadcastRatelimit` | sellerId | 1 / 7 d | `POST /api/seller/broadcast` (in addition to DB 7-day check) |
| `caseCreateRatelimit` | userId | 5 / 24 h | `POST /api/cases` |
| `caseMessageRatelimit` | userId | 30 / 60 min | `POST /api/cases/[id]/messages` |
| `customOrderRequestRatelimit` | userId | 10 / 24 h | `POST /api/messages/custom-order-request` |
| `stripeLoginLinkRatelimit` | userId | 10 / 60 min | `POST /api/stripe/connect/login-link` |
| `markReadRatelimit` | userId | 60 / 60 min | `POST /api/notifications/read-all` (fail open — silent success on limit) |

### Spam prevention guards

All blocked actions return 400; spam attempts for self-actions are also logged to Sentry via `logSecurityEvent()` in `src/lib/security.ts`.

| Guard | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Self-review blocked | `api/reviews/route.ts` | Added + Sentry logged |
| Self-follow blocked | `api/follow/[sellerId]/route.ts` | Present + Sentry logged |
| Own-commission interest blocked | `api/commission/[id]/interest/route.ts` | Present + Sentry logged |
| Duplicate commission interest blocked | DB `@@unique` constraint | Present |
| Commission interest on non-OPEN request | `api/commission/[id]/interest/route.ts` | Present |
| Self-messaging blocked | `messages/new/page.tsx`, `api/messages/custom-order-request` | Present |
| Reviewing own listing blocked | `api/reviews/route.ts` | Present (same as self-review) |

### Input sanitization (`src/lib/sanitize.ts`)

- `sanitizeText(input)` — strips HTML tags, `javascript:` protocol, event handler attributes; used on short fields
- `sanitizeRichText(input)` — strips `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `javascript:`, event handlers; used on long-form content

Applied at DB boundary: listing title/description (new + edit), seller displayName/tagline/bio, commission title/description, review text, broadcast messages.

### Numeric validation

Price: ≥ $0, ≤ $100,000 · Stock: non-negative · Processing time: ≤ 365 days · Commission budget: min ≤ max, non-negative.

### Sentry security tracking (`src/lib/security.ts`)

`logSecurityEvent(event, details)` — Sentry breadcrumb for all events; `captureEvent` for `ownership_violation` and `spam_attempt`.

### Bot prevention — `chargesEnabled`

Migration `20260331205748_charges_enabled`: `chargesEnabled Boolean @default(false)` on `SellerProfile`. Browse, homepage Fresh/Favorites, similar items, and seller shop all filter `seller.chargesEnabled: true`. Dashboard shows amber "Connect Stripe" warning when false. Stripe Connect callback (`api/stripe/connect/create`) sets `chargesEnabled = account.charges_enabled`. All 7 existing sellers backfilled to `true` via `scripts/backfill-charges-enabled.ts`.

### Clerk security settings (configured in Clerk dashboard)

- Bot protection via Cloudflare Turnstile — enabled
- Disposable email blocking — enabled
- Email subaddress blocking — enabled
- Strict user enumeration protection — enabled
- Account lockout policy — enabled

## PWA Setup (complete — 2026-03-31)

- **`public/manifest.json`** — name, short_name, description, start_url, display: standalone, background_color `#FAFAF8`, theme_color `#1C1917`, shortcuts (Browse, My Account), categories (shopping, lifestyle)
- **`public/icon-192.png`** and **`public/icon-512.png`** — generated from `public/logo.svg` via `sharp`; regenerated with `#1C1917` dark background so logo is visible on all surfaces (192×192 and 512×512)
- **`public/favicon.png`** — copy of `icon-192.png`; used as the browser tab favicon (replaces `favicon.ico` which was the Vercel default triangle)
- **`src/app/layout.tsx`** — `icons: { icon: "/favicon.png", apple: "/icon-192.png" }`; also has `manifest`, `appleWebApp`, `formatDetection`, `viewport` with `themeColor`
- **`src/app/offline/page.tsx`** — server component; logo + "You're offline" heading + "Try again" link (`<a href="/">`)

## Security Headers (complete — 2026-03-31)

`next.config.ts` updated with `headers()` async function applying to all routes (`source: '/(.*)'`):

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control` | `on` |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `SAMEORIGIN` |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` |
| `Permissions-Policy` | `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(self)` |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` |

**CSP status**: `Content-Security-Policy` (**enforced** as of 2026-04-02). Previously report-only; switched after fixing missing `https://clerk.thegrainline.com` in `script-src-elem` which caused 3K Sentry CSP violation events. Violations continue to be logged to `/api/csp-report` and Sentry under tag `csp_violation`.

## chargesEnabled Backfill (hotfix — 2026-03-31)

The `chargesEnabled Boolean @default(false)` field caused all existing sellers to fail the new filter, blanking browse. Two rounds of backfill were needed:
- **Round 1**: `scripts/backfill-charges-enabled.ts` — updated sellers with `stripeAccountId` (2 sellers). Browse still showed 0 — active listings belonged to dev sellers without Stripe.
- **Round 2**: `updateMany` with no `where` clause — set all 7 existing sellers to `true`. Going forward, only brand-new sellers need to complete Stripe Connect to appear publicly.

**Stripe webhook now handles `account.updated`**: When Stripe notifies of a seller account status change, `chargesEnabled` is synced automatically. If a seller's account is disabled, Sentry is notified via `logSecurityEvent`. `account.application.deauthorized` clears `stripeAccountId` and sets `chargesEnabled = false` when a seller disconnects the platform.

## Content Security Policy (enforced — 2026-04-02)

`Content-Security-Policy` is **enforced** in `next.config.ts` as of 2026-04-02. Was report-only; switched after fixing missing `https://clerk.thegrainline.com` in `script-src-elem` (was causing 3K Sentry CSP violation events from Clerk's custom domain scripts).

**Violation reporting**: `POST /api/csp-report` — public route (in middleware `isPublic`); logs to Sentry breadcrumbs; captures Sentry events for `script` and `frame` directive violations; logs to console in dev mode.

**Directives summary**:

| Directive | Key allowed sources |
|---|---|
| `script-src` | `'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'` (Next.js hydration requires both) |
| `script-src-elem` | `'self' 'unsafe-inline'` + `clerk.com *.clerk.accounts.dev *.clerk.com clerk.thegrainline.com js.stripe.com cdnjs.cloudflare.com` (note: `clerk.thegrainline.com` was missing here before, causing 3K violations) |
| `style-src` | `'self' 'unsafe-inline'` |
| `img-src` | `'self' data: blob: https:` (HTTPS only — HTTP removed) |
| `font-src` | `'self' data: fonts.gstatic.com` |
| `connect-src` | `'self'` + Clerk, Stripe (`api` + `hooks`), UploadThing, Sentry, Upstash, OpenStreetMap, `wss://*.clerk.*` |
| `frame-src` | `'self'` + Stripe (`js` + `hooks`), Clerk |
| `worker-src` | `'self' blob:` |
| `media-src` | `'self'` |
| `object-src` | `'none'` |
| `form-action` | `'self'` + Clerk (`*.clerk.accounts.dev *.clerk.com`) |
| `frame-ancestors` | `'self'` (equivalent to `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`) |

**CSP maintenance**: When adding new third-party services, add their domains to `next.config.ts` `securityHeaders`. Any violations in production appear in Sentry under tag `csp_violation`.

- Domain: thegrainline.com
- Routing addresses (all forward to drewyoung910@gmail.com):
  - legal@thegrainline.com (DMCA, legal notices)
  - support@thegrainline.com (general support)
  - hello@thegrainline.com

- Existing Resend setup unaffected (Resend uses send.thegrainline.com subdomain for outbound only)

## Geo-Blocking (complete — 2026-04-01, US-only updated 2026-04-01)

US only (Canada removed to align with Terms of Service Section 31). Implemented in `src/middleware.ts` at the top of the middleware function body, before auth checks.

- Reads `request.geo?.country` (populated by Vercel edge in production; `undefined` in local dev — geo-blocking never fires locally)
- Non-US requests are redirected to `/not-available`
- `/not-available` is in `isPublic` so the redirect doesn't loop through auth
- Static assets (`/_next`, `/favicon`, `/logo`, `/icon`, `/manifest`, `/robots`, `/sitemap`) are allowed through without redirect
- **All `/api` routes bypass geo-blocking** — webhooks (Stripe, Clerk) and API calls originate from servers, not browsers, so geo-checking would break them
- **`src/app/not-available/page.tsx`** — branded page with logo, "Not available in your region" heading, brief explanation, VPN note; `robots: { index: false }` metadata

## Notification Preferences (complete — 2026-04-01)

Sellers and buyers can control which in-site notifications they receive.

### Schema
- **`User.notificationPreferences Json @default("{}")`** — stores a `Record<string, boolean>` where `false` means opted out. Migration: `20260401003152_notification_preferences`

### `createNotification` — preference check
Before inserting a notification, fetches the recipient's `notificationPreferences` and returns `null` (skips create) if `prefs[type] === false`. Never throws — preference failures don't break the main flow.

### Settings page (`/account/settings`)
- Server component; auth required
- Queries `notificationPreferences` + `sellerProfile` presence
- `DEFAULT_OFF` types (default to off unless explicitly enabled): `SELLER_BROADCAST`, `NEW_FAVORITE`, `NEW_BLOG_COMMENT`, `BLOG_COMMENT_REPLY`, `EMAIL_SELLER_BROADCAST`, `EMAIL_NEW_FOLLOWER`
- **In-App Notifications** (5 groups):
  - **From Makers You Follow** (3): `FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_LISTING`, `FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_BLOG`, `SELLER_BROADCAST` (default OFF)
  - **Orders & Cases** (6): `NEW_ORDER`, `ORDER_SHIPPED`, `ORDER_DELIVERED`, `CASE_OPENED` (sellers), `CASE_MESSAGE`, `CASE_RESOLVED`
  - **Your Shop** (sellers, 8): `NEW_MESSAGE`, `NEW_REVIEW`, `NEW_FOLLOWER`, `CUSTOM_ORDER_REQUEST`, `CUSTOM_ORDER_LINK`, `COMMISSION_INTEREST`, `NEW_FAVORITE` (default OFF), `LISTING_APPROVED`/`LISTING_REJECTED` (always-on labels)
  - **Blog** (sellers, 2): `NEW_BLOG_COMMENT` (default OFF), `BLOG_COMMENT_REPLY` (default OFF)
- **Email Notifications** (10 toggleable types, 4 subgroups):
  - Messages & Orders: `EMAIL_NEW_MESSAGE`, `EMAIL_NEW_ORDER` (sellers), `EMAIL_CUSTOM_ORDER` (sellers)
  - Cases & Reviews: `EMAIL_CASE_OPENED` (sellers), `EMAIL_CASE_MESSAGE`, `EMAIL_CASE_RESOLVED`, `EMAIL_NEW_REVIEW` (sellers)
  - From Makers: `EMAIL_FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_LISTING`, `EMAIL_SELLER_BROADCAST` (default OFF)
  - Your Shop (sellers): `EMAIL_NEW_FOLLOWER` (default OFF)
- Linked from Account Settings section on `/account` as "Notification preferences →"
- **NotificationBell** `markAllRead` button always visible in dropdown (removed `unreadCount > 0` condition); styled `text-xs text-neutral-500 hover:text-neutral-800 underline`

### `NotificationToggle` component (`src/components/NotificationToggle.tsx`)
- `"use client"` — optimistic toggle (immediate UI update, revert on error)
- Calls `POST /api/account/notifications/preferences` with `{ type, enabled }`

### Preferences API (`/api/account/notifications/preferences`)
- Auth required; reads current prefs JSON, sets `prefs[type] = enabled`, writes back via `prisma.user.update`

## Performance Improvements (complete — 2026-04-02)

- **Notification polling** (`NotificationBell.tsx`): 30s → 5 min → 10 min (600000ms). `UnreadBadge.tsx` default: 15s → 10 min (600000ms). Combined ~40x reduction from original polling rates.
- **Notification cleanup prune**: `GET /api/notifications` only runs `deleteMany` when `getMinutes() === 0` — ~1/60th of requests instead of every poll (60x reduction in unnecessary DB writes)
- **Browse `getSellerRatingMap` N+1 fixed**: replaced 2 sequential Prisma queries + in-memory join with a single SQL `JOIN` (`AVG(r."ratingX2")::float / 2.0`, `GROUP BY l."sellerId"`) — eliminates a full extra round trip on every browse page load
- **Popular tags API** (`GET /api/search/popular-tags`): ISR 1hr cache, raw SQL unnest; search bar shows top 8 listing tags on focus when input is empty — one fetch per session, cached at CDN edge
- **Popular blog tags API** (`GET /api/search/popular-blog-tags`): ISR 1hr cache, raw SQL unnest from `BlogPost.tags` where `status = 'PUBLISHED'`; `BlogSearchBar` uses this endpoint (not `/api/search/popular-tags`) — shows popular blog topics, not listing tags
- **Search suggestions trigger at 2 chars** (was 3) — faster discoverability
- **`NotificationBell` gated on sign-in state**: `useUser().isSignedIn` checked before any fetch — no 404 polls for signed-out users
- **Header `cart:updated` listener gated on `isLoggedIn`**: only fires `loadCartCount` when `loadAll` confirmed sign-in — eliminates signed-out cart 401s on add-to-cart events
- **`UserAvatarMenu` dropdown z-index confirmed** at `z-[200]`; Clerk modal CSS overrides confirmed in `globals.css` (`z-index: 9999`, `min-width: min(90vw, 800px)`)
- **ISR not applied** — block filtering requires per-user server rendering on all public listing/browse pages. Per-user caching is the correct future optimization when traffic justifies it.
- **`/api/health`** — static endpoint (`force-static`, no DB, no auth) for UptimeRobot monitoring

## Input Validation — Zod (complete — 2026-04-01)

All 33 API route files that accept request bodies now use **Zod** for schema validation. Schemas are colocated at the top of each route file (not in a shared file). Validation runs immediately after auth + rate-limit checks, before any database calls.

**Pattern used in every route:**
```ts
import { z } from "zod";

const MySchema = z.object({
  field: z.string().min(1).max(200),
  optionalField: z.number().positive().optional(),
});

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // 1. auth check
  // 2. rate limit check
  // 3. Zod parse
  let body;
  try {
    body = MySchema.parse(await request.json());
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof z.ZodError) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid input", details: e.errors }, { status: 400 });
    }
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid JSON" }, { status: 400 });
  }
  // 4. database calls using body.field (typed and validated)
}
```

**Standard constraints applied:**
- Prices in cents: `z.number().int().min(0).max(10000000)` (max $100,000)
- Text fields: `.max(N)` matching existing `.slice(0, N)` guards
- Enums: `z.enum([...])` with literal values from the route's existing logic
- IDs: `z.string().min(1)`
- Booleans: `z.boolean()` (not strings)
- Arrays: `z.array(...).max(N)` with reasonable limits

**Skipped routes** (no request body parsing):
- `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` — reads raw body for HMAC verification
- `src/app/api/clerk/webhook/route.ts` — reads raw body for svix verification
- `src/app/api/csp-report/route.ts` — logging sink, no state mutation, body structure is browser-defined
- `src/app/api/cart/checkout/route.ts` — POST accepts no body (reads cart from DB by session)

## CSRF Audit (complete — 2026-04-01)

All Next.js API routes are implicitly CSRF-safe for browser requests because Clerk's middleware enforces SameSite cookies and the App Router does not set CORS headers by default. Full audit documented in `src/lib/security.ts` (block comment at top of file).

**Public POST/PATCH/DELETE routes (no `auth()` call) and why each is safe:**

| Route | Reason safe |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/stripe/webhook` | Stripe-Signature HMAC verification; no session cookie |
| `POST /api/clerk/webhook` | Svix signature verification; no session cookie |
| `POST /api/csp-report` | Read-only logging sink; no state mutation |
| `POST /api/newsletter` | Low-risk public subscription; email address upsert only |
| `POST /api/listings/[id]/view` | Analytics-only increment; deduped via httpOnly cookie |
| `POST /api/listings/[id]/click` | Analytics-only increment; no sensitive mutation |

All other POST/PATCH/DELETE routes call `auth()` and return 401 before any data access.

## Comprehensive Security Audit (2026-04-17)

Full-codebase audit across 79 API routes, 8 parallel audit passes. 44 findings identified and fixed in a single commit. Zero TypeScript errors. All fixes deployed to production.

### Critical fixes
- **Blog XSS** — `marked.parse()` output was rendered via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with no sanitization. Initially fixed with `isomorphic-dompurify`, but jsdom has an ESM/CJS incompatibility that crashes Vercel's serverless runtime ("Failed to load external module jsdom"). Replaced with `sanitize-html` (pure JS, no jsdom dependency). Same tag/attribute allowlist: 28+ allowed tags, 8 attribute groups, `http`/`https`/`mailto` schemes only. File: `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`.
- **JSON-LD XSS** — All 12 `dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(...) }}` instances across 6 files were vulnerable to script-tag breakout via user-controlled strings (e.g. listing title `</script><script>alert(1)`). `JSON.stringify` does NOT escape `</`. New `src/lib/json-ld.ts` exports `safeJsonLd()` which replaces `<` with `\u003c` (valid JSON, browser-safe). Applied to all JSON-LD script tags: listing detail, seller profile, makers, commission, metro browse, metro+category browse.
- **Stock oversell race** — Webhook used `Math.max(0, staleQty - qty)` which is not atomic under concurrent webhooks. Replaced with raw SQL `GREATEST(0, "stockQuantity" - qty)` (floor at 0, prevents negative stock). Both cart and single-listing webhook paths fixed. File: `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`.
- **No stock check at checkout** — Neither checkout route validated `stockQuantity >= requested quantity` for IN_STOCK items. Added guards to both `checkout-seller` and `checkout/single`. Buyers now get 400 "Not enough stock" instead of a Stripe session for unavailable items.
- **Private listings on seller profile** — `src/app/seller/[id]/page.tsx` listing query had no `isPrivate: false` filter. Custom order listings reserved for specific buyers appeared publicly. Fixed.
- **Attachment URL phishing** — `sendMessage` accepted arbitrary URLs in message attachments with no domain validation. Added R2 origin prefix check (`CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL`). Non-R2 URLs are silently skipped. File: `src/app/messages/[id]/page.tsx`.

### High fixes
- **checkout-seller: vacationMode** — Route was missing vacation check (checkout/single had it). Added guard after chargesEnabled check.
- **checkout-seller: self-purchase** — Route was missing buyer === seller check. Added guard (Stripe ToS violation).
- **Refund double-refund race** — `sellerRefundId` null-check and Stripe call were not atomic. Added `prisma.order.updateMany({ where: { sellerRefundId: null } })` atomic lock with rollback on failure. Also added partial refund amount cap against order total. File: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/refund/route.ts`.
- **Case resolve: Stripe refund outside transaction** — Stripe refund issued before DB transaction; failure orphans the refund. Added try/catch with `ORPHANED REFUND` console.error for manual reconciliation. Added partial refund cap. File: `src/app/api/cases/[id]/resolve/route.ts`.
- **Label purchase double-purchase race** — Read-check guard for `labelStatus !== "PURCHASED"` races under concurrent requests. Added atomic `$executeRaw` UPDATE with WHERE condition + rollback on Shippo failure. File: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/label/route.ts`.
- **listingSnapshot never written** — `OrderItem.listingSnapshot` was always null despite being documented. Added snapshot capture (title, description, priceCents, imageUrls, category, tags, sellerName, capturedAt) to both webhook order creation paths. Expanded single-listing query to include snapshot fields.
- **Sentry `sendDefaultPii: true`** — Server and edge Sentry configs were sending Clerk session cookies to Sentry on every error. Changed to `false`. Client config unchanged (no cookies).
- **Sitemap leaks private listings** — `src/app/sitemap.ts` had no `isPrivate: false` filter. Private listing IDs were published in sitemap.xml. Fixed.
- **Custom listing `reservedForUserId` not validated** — `dashboard/listings/custom/page.tsx` accepted any `reservedForUserId` without verifying it matched the other conversation participant. Added validation.

### Medium fixes
- **Webhook cart quantity desync (fix #11)** — Webhook read live cart `it.quantity` for OrderItem creation and stock decrement, but a buyer could modify cart quantities via `/api/cart/update` between Stripe session creation and webhook execution. Order records would show different quantities than what was paid. Fix: webhook now expands `line_items` from the Stripe session, builds a `paidItemMap` (listingId → {quantity, priceCents}), and uses those authoritative values instead of live cart data. Cart is still read for listing metadata (title, photos, seller) and snapshot fields, but quantity and price come from Stripe.
- **Stock decrement floor at 0** — Upgraded from Prisma `{ decrement }` to raw SQL `GREATEST(0, "stockQuantity" - qty)`. Under concurrent webhooks, `{ decrement }` is atomic but can go negative (e.g. two buyers both buy the last item, both webhooks fire, stock goes to -1). The `GREATEST(0, ...)` floor prevents negative stock while still marking SOLD_OUT.
- **Low-stock notification accuracy** — Both cart and single-listing webhook paths now re-read `stockQuantity` from DB after the decrement (not from the stale pre-decrement query). Prevents false low-stock notifications under concurrent purchases.
- **Stale cart price** — `checkout-seller` used `CartItem.priceCents` (snapshot from add-time) instead of live `listing.priceCents`. Changed `unit_amount` and `itemsSubtotalCents` to use `i.listing.priceCents`.
- **displayName max 200 vs Stripe 100** — Zod `displayName` max was 200 in both checkout routes; Stripe's `display_name` limit is 100. Tightened to `.max(100)`.
- **Rate limiters added** — 7 new limiters wired into 8 routes: `shippingQuoteRatelimit` (quote), `newsletterRatelimit` (newsletter, IP-keyed), `blogCommentRatelimit` (comments), `notifyRatelimit` (stock notifications), `stripeConnectRatelimit` (connect/create + connect/dashboard), `clickDedupRatelimit` (per-IP+listing 24h dedup on click endpoint).
- **/api/health in isPublic** — UptimeRobot was getting 401s. Added to middleware public list.
- **Case resolve: partial refund stock restore** — Changed condition from `resolution !== "DISMISSED"` to `resolution === "REFUND_FULL"`. Partial refunds no longer restore full inventory (consistent with seller refund route).
- **Seller email leak** — `cart/route.ts` used `seller?.user?.email` as `sellerName` fallback. Removed; now falls back to `"Seller"`.
- **`buyer: true` over-fetch** — 4 files (sales detail, sales list, buyer order detail, checkout success) fetched entire User row including `shippingPhone`, `notificationPreferences`, `banReason`. Narrowed to `{ id, name, email, imageUrl }`.
- **cart/add: no status check** — DRAFT/SOLD/HIDDEN listings could be added to cart. Added `status !== "ACTIVE"` guard.
- **cart/update: no stock validation** — Buyer could set quantity to 50 when 1 in stock. Added IN_STOCK quantity check.
- **Custom order request: target not verified as seller** — Route checked User existence but not SellerProfile or `acceptsCustomOrders`. Added both checks.
- **Admin verification: 6 actions missing audit log** — `approveGuildMember`, `rejectGuildMember`, `approveGuildMaster`, `rejectGuildMaster`, `revokeMember`, `revokeMaster` now all call `logAdminAction`.
- **Click endpoint: missing per-listing 24h dedup** — View endpoint had `profileViewRatelimit` per IP+listing; click endpoint only had global IP limit. Added `clickDedupRatelimit` with same pattern.
- **Edit listing: priceCents=0 allowed** — Create blocked `<= 0` but edit only blocked `< 0`. Changed to `<= 0`.

### Low fixes
- **Fulfillment state machine** — No backwards transition guard. Added `validTransitions` map; returns 400 for invalid transitions (e.g., DELIVERED → SHIPPED).
- **Admin email HTML injection** — `body.replace(/\n/g, "<br/>")` with no escaping. Added `&`, `<`, `>` escaping before `<br/>` conversion.
- **Webhook P2002 handling** — Concurrent duplicate webhook delivery caused unhandled P2002 → 500 → noisy retry loop. Added P2002 detection in outer catch, returns 200.
- **Webhook payment_status** — Missing `s.payment_status !== "paid"` assertion after session re-retrieval. Added defense-in-depth check.
- **Banned user messaging** — `sendMessage` didn't check `me.banned`. Added guard returning `{ ok: false, error: "suspended" }`.
- **`/api/whoami` sessionId** — Public endpoint returned Clerk `sessionId`. Removed from response.
- **Self-favorite** — Seller could favorite own listings (+1 to relevance score). Added seller ownership check before upsert.
- **`console.log` in favorites** — Debug statements logging internal DB user IDs and roles to Vercel logs. Removed.
- **Sentry tracesSampleRate** — Was `1` (100%) in all 3 configs. Changed to `0.1` (10%) to reduce cost/quota usage.

## Second Security Audit (2026-04-18)

Focused audit on code paths NOT covered by the prior 44-finding audit. 6 agents scanned seller dashboard actions, review/follow/block edge cases, search/browse/listing detail, cron/email/notifications, account pages, and infrastructure/deps/config.

### Critical fixes
- **@clerk/nextjs 7.0.7 → 7.2.3** — fixes middleware route protection bypass (GHSA-vqx2-fgx2-5wq9). Attacker could access `/dashboard`, `/admin`, etc. without auth.
- **next 16.2.1 → 16.2.4** — fixes Server Components DoS (GHSA-q4gf-8mx6-v5v3). Crafted request crashes Vercel instance.

### High fixes
- **Banned seller listings via direct URL** — `listing/[id]/page.tsx` had no `seller.user.banned` check. Added `notFound()` after chargesEnabled check. Contrast: `seller/[id]/page.tsx` already had this.
- **CSP frame-src** — YouTube (`youtube-nocookie.com`) and Vimeo (`player.vimeo.com`) added for blog video embeds. R2 CDN added to `media-src`. Unused `fonts.gstatic.com` removed from `font-src`.

### Medium fixes
- **Edit listing page info disclosure** — `dashboard/listings/[id]/edit/page.tsx` loaded any listing by ID with no auth. Now uses `findFirst` with `seller: { user: { clerkId } }` ownership filter.
- **toggleFeaturedListing** — No ownership check; any listing ID could be featured. Added `prisma.listing.count({ where: { id, sellerId } })` guard.
- **CRON_SECRET undefined bypass** — Both cron routes compared `Bearer ${undefined}` which an attacker could match. Changed to fail-closed: `if (!cronSecret || bearer !== cronSecret)`.
- **Broadcast imageUrl** — Accepted any string. Changed Zod to `z.string().url().regex(/^https:\/\//)`.
- **Notification preferences allowlist** — `type` field accepted arbitrary strings; users could silence always-on notifications like `LISTING_APPROVED`. Changed to `z.enum([...34 valid keys...])`.
- **Browse input bounds** — `q` capped at 200 chars; `pageNum` capped at 500; `minPrice`/`maxPrice` clamped to `[0, 500000]` (raised from 100K to 500K for high-value custom furniture).
- **Blog search rate limiting** — Both `/api/blog/search` and `/api/blog/search/suggestions` now have IP-based `searchRatelimit` + 200-char query cap.

### Low fixes
- **Review edit/reply sanitization** — PATCH review and seller reply were missing `sanitizeRichText()` (POST had it). Added to both.
- **Profile text field sanitization** — `dashboard/profile/page.tsx` `updateSellerProfile` was missing `sanitizeText`/`sanitizeRichText` on tagline, bio, storyBody, policies (the `dashboard/seller` version had them). Added.
- **Gift wrap price bounds** — No min/max validation. Clamped to `[0, $100]` (10000 cents).
- **Seller/listing page user over-fetch** — `seller/[id]/page.tsx` narrowed from `user: true` (13 fields) to 5 fields. `listing/[id]/page.tsx` narrowed from `user: true` to 5 fields.
- **Follow re-notification** — `NEW_FOLLOWER` notification fired on every follow POST (including re-follows via upsert update branch). Added `findUnique` check; notification only sent on new follows.
- **Admin email try/catch** — `resend.emails.send()` was called without try/catch. Wrapped.
- **Saved posts block filter** — Blog posts tab on `/account/saved` was missing `blockedSellerIds` filter. Added.
- **Following listing count** — `_count.listings` included DRAFT/HIDDEN/PRIVATE. Changed to `{ where: { status: "ACTIVE", isPrivate: false } }`.
- **Case thread staff email** — Case message author email leaked to buyers for EMPLOYEE/ADMIN authors. Now shows "Grainline Staff" instead.

### Database indexes (migration `20260416120000_add_performance_indexes`)
- `Order(paidAt)` — analytics range queries
- `Order(fulfillmentStatus)` — dashboard/admin order filters
- `SavedSearch(userId)` — user's saved searches lookup
- `Case(buyerId)` — buyer order detail case lookup
- `Case(status, createdAt)` — admin cases queue sort
- `CaseMessage(caseId)` — case thread message loading
- `Notification(read, createdAt)` — cleanup cron and read/unread filtering

### Known remaining items (not security-critical)
- `defu` prototype pollution (transitive via Prisma) — build-time only, not runtime. Prisma upgraded to 7.7 but `defu` fix requires upstream `c12` update.
- `hono` CVEs (transitive via `@prisma/dev`) — not in production runtime, dev tooling only
- `Conversation`/`Message` lack `onDelete: Cascade` — will matter for GDPR account deletion
- `UserReport` missing `resolvedAt`/`resolvedById` fields — audit trail gap

### Post-audit review fixes (2026-04-18)
- **Cron routes added to `isPublic`** — `/api/cron(.*)` was missing from middleware's public list. Vercel Cron couldn't reach the guild-metrics and guild-member-check routes because Clerk middleware blocked them before the `CRON_SECRET` check could run. Now functional.
- **Browse price cap raised $100K → $500K** — high-value custom furniture (dining tables, commissioned pieces) was being filtered out. Upper bound kept to prevent abuse via absurd values in PostgreSQL queries.
- **Notification preference keys: shared constant** — `VALID_PREFERENCE_KEYS` exported from `src/lib/notifications.ts` as single source of truth. Preferences API imports it instead of duplicating 34 strings. Adding new notification types now requires updating only one file.
- **`$queryRawUnsafe` security comment** — Added rationale comment to `src/app/commission/page.tsx` explaining why `$queryRawUnsafe` is used and confirming all user input is bound via positional parameters.

### Deployment rule
**Always run `prisma migrate deploy` BEFORE `vercel --prod`** for migrations that add columns or constraints. Index-only migrations are safe to apply after deploy (queries are slower but correct). The pattern: `npx dotenv-cli -e .env -- npx prisma migrate deploy` → verify → `npx vercel --prod`.

### Infrastructure improvements (2026-04-18)
- **`.github/dependabot.yml`** — weekly npm security updates; minor/patch grouped into single PR; major version bumps ignored (require manual review); 10 open PR limit. Would have caught the Clerk 7.0.7 auth bypass CVE automatically.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — runs `prisma generate` → `npx tsc --noEmit` → `npm audit` (informational, `continue-on-error: true`) on every PR and push to main. Node 22. `prisma generate` is required before `tsc` because Prisma 7.7 changed the client generation output. Audit is informational — Dependabot PRs surface actionable fixes.

### Dependency upgrades (via Dependabot PR #2, 2026-04-18)
- Prisma 7.6.0 → 7.7.0, Stripe SDK 19.0 → 19.3, React 19.2.4 → 19.2.5
- @sentry/nextjs 10.46 → 10.49, maplibre-gl 5.22 → 5.23, resend 6.1 → 6.12, svix 1.89 → 1.90
- AWS SDK (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`) and type definition updates
- **Stripe `apiVersion`**: removed explicit `"2025-09-30.clover"` from `src/lib/stripe.ts` — SDK 19.3 changed the valid type union. Now uses the SDK's default API version.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: excluded `prisma/seed.ts`, `prisma/seed-bulk.ts`, `prisma/seeds`, and `scripts` directories from tsc. Prisma 7.7 changed PrismaClient import behavior which broke seed file compilation. These are build-only scripts, not runtime code.
- **Webhook oversell detection** — both cart and single-listing webhook paths now log `[OVERSELL]` via `console.error` when pre-decrement stock was insufficient for the ordered quantity. Shows in Vercel logs and Sentry breadcrumbs. No schema change (Order.notes doesn't exist). Oversold orders require manual seller review and potential refund.
- **Neon connection pooler** — TODO comment in `prisma/schema.prisma` documenting when to switch to pooled connection string (`-pooler` hostname). Current `PrismaPg` adapter in `src/lib/db.ts` uses direct connection via `DATABASE_URL`. Switch when concurrent connections exceed ~50.

## Performance Optimization — Batch 1 (2026-04-18)

### Image loading
- **`loading="lazy"`** added to 15 image locations across ListingCard (all listing grids/scroll rows), HeroMosaic (all except first 6 — 3 per row visible above fold), RecentlyViewed, FeedClient (listings, blog, broadcasts), browse featured/list-view, homepage Meet a Maker (banner + avatar), homepage blog covers + author avatars, homepage From Your Makers cards. Previously: 0 images had lazy loading; all ~51 homepage images loaded eagerly.
- **R2 cache headers**: `CacheControl: "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"` set on all new uploads via `PutObjectCommand` in `src/app/api/upload/presign/route.ts`. Keys include timestamp+random suffix so they are content-addressed and never change. Previously: no cache headers — images may have been re-fetched from R2 origin on every visit. Note: existing images uploaded before this change still lack cache headers; they would need a one-time migration script to set headers on existing R2 objects.

### JavaScript bundle
- **Maplibre GL lazy-loaded** via `next/dynamic({ ssr: false })` in `MakersMapSection.tsx`. Defers ~1MB maplibre-gl JS bundle until the map section hydrates client-side (below the fold on most viewports). Loading skeleton shown while JS loads. Previously: statically imported — every homepage visitor downloaded the full map library.
- **Maplibre CSS removed from `globals.css`** (was `@import 'maplibre-gl/dist/maplibre-gl.css'` — 68KB parsed on every page of the entire site). CSS import moved into each map component individually (AllSellersMap, LocationPicker, SellersMap, MapCard, MaplibreMap). With dynamic import, CSS is code-split and only loaded when a map renders. Non-map pages (browse, listing detail, cart, checkout, account, blog) pay zero CSS cost.

### CSS animations
- **ScrollSection `transition-all` → `transition-[opacity,transform]`** — previously told the browser to watch all CSS properties for changes on every scroll-triggered fade-in animation, causing unnecessary style recalculation. Now only transitions the two properties that actually change.

### Batch 2 (planned, not yet implemented)
- Deduplicate `getBlockedUserIdsFor` call (called twice per homepage load for logged-in users)
- Fix `getSellerRatingMap` N+1 on homepage (single JOIN like browse page already does)
- Parallelize featured maker + seller ratings + logged-in user data queries
- Add `take: 200` limit on mapPoints query (currently serializes all opted-in sellers into RSC payload)

### Batch 3 (planned, requires external service)
- Cloudflare Image Resizing (`?width=400&format=webp`) for responsive image delivery
- Or `next/image` with custom R2 loader
- `fetchpriority="high"` on LCP images

## Blog & Commission Room UX Fixes (2026-04-18)

- **`@tailwindcss/typography` installed** — `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography"` in `globals.css`. Blog post body `prose` classes now functional: paragraph spacing, styled headings, blockquotes, code blocks, lists. Previously all `prose-*` classes were no-ops since blog launch (plugin was never installed).
- **Blog comment thread borders** — `border-neutral-100` → `border-neutral-300` on L2/L3 reply indent lines in `BlogReplyToggle.tsx`. Threading hierarchy now visible (was white-on-white).
- **Blog cover images** — fixed `h-44` → `aspect-[16/9]` on grid cards. Consistent proportions regardless of source image shape.
- **Blog featured post label** — amber "Featured" badge added above the type badge on the hero card. Previously the featured post was larger but had no label.
- **Commission reference image disclaimer** — added to create form: "Only upload images you own or have permission to share. Reference images are visible to makers who view your request." Addresses the legal gap where buyers upload Pinterest/Google images with no guidance.
- **Commission interest button** — upgraded from `text-xs border-only` to `text-sm rounded-md bg-neutral-900` filled button. Primary conversion action is now visible and tappable on mobile. Confirmed state also restyled.
- **Commission reference images** — 64px → 96px with `rounded-lg` on board cards. Reference images are the most compelling visual element on a commission request; they were barely visible before.

## Stock Reservation System (2026-04-18)

Stock is now reserved at checkout time (session creation), not at payment time (webhook). Eliminates the oversell race condition where two concurrent buyers could both pay for the last item.

### Flow
1. **Checkout route** (both `checkout/single` and `checkout-seller`): atomic SQL `UPDATE "Listing" SET "stockQuantity" = "stockQuantity" - qty WHERE id = X AND "stockQuantity" >= qty`. If 0 rows affected → 400 "not enough stock". Two concurrent buyers can't both reserve the last item — the SQL WHERE guard is atomic at the database level.
2. **`checkout.session.completed` webhook**: stock already decremented. Just checks if SOLD_OUT status needed. No decrement.
3. **`checkout.session.expired` webhook** (NEW): restores reserved stock. Single-item: reads `listingId` + `quantity` from session metadata. Cart: retrieves `line_items.data.price.product` from Stripe (expanded) to get `listingId` per line item. Also restores ACTIVE status if listing was SOLD_OUT with stock > 0.
4. **Session expiry**: `expires_at` set to 30 minutes (was Stripe's 24h default). Stock shouldn't be held longer than necessary.

### Validation ordering (critical invariant)
**Stock reservation MUST be the last validation before `stripe.checkout.sessions.create`.** All 400-return paths (chargesEnabled, offersGiftWrapping, HMAC verification, listing status, isPrivate, self-purchase, vacation mode) must precede the reservation. If a validation returns 400 after stock is reserved but before a session is created, there is no session to expire and no webhook to restore the stock — it is permanently lost. This was a critical bug found in the post-implementation audit and fixed by reordering.

### Error handling
- **Stripe session creation failure**: both checkout routes track reservations (`reservedListingId`/`reservedQuantity` for single, `reservedItems[]` for cart) and restore stock in the `catch` block. Without this, stock would be permanently lost on Stripe outages.
- **Cart partial batch failure**: if reserving item B fails after item A was reserved, item A's stock is restored before returning 400.
- **Expired + completed race**: expired handler checks `prisma.order.findFirst({ where: { stripeSessionId } })` before restoring — if the order exists (payment completed), stock is NOT restored.
- **line_items expansion**: webhook uses `"line_items.data.price.product"` (not just `"line_items"`) to access `product.metadata.listingId`. Without the product expansion, `price.product` is a string ID, not an object with metadata.
- **expires_at = 31 minutes** (not 30): Stripe's minimum is exactly 30 minutes. Clock skew between `Date.now()` and Stripe's server could reject sessions at the 30-minute boundary. 1-minute buffer is standard practice.

### Stripe webhook setup required
Add `checkout.session.expired` to your Stripe webhook events:
Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → endpoint → Add events → `checkout.session.expired`

Without this, expired sessions won't trigger stock restoration. Stock reserved by abandoned checkouts would be permanently held until manual adjustment.

### Seller experience
- Sellers see nothing when stock is reserved or restored. No notifications.
- Sellers only see NEW_ORDER notifications after payment is confirmed (unchanged).
- If a reservation causes stock to hit 0, the listing shows "Out of Stock" to other buyers during the 30-minute window. If the session expires, stock restores and the listing becomes available again automatically.

### Post-implementation audit (2026-04-18)
- **Stale `grainline.co` domain fixed** — 7 files had the old domain in canonical URLs and JSON-LD structured data (blog, browse, listing detail, seller profile, seller shop). All updated to `thegrainline.com`. Google was receiving wrong canonical URLs on every crawl.
- **Debug `console.log` removed** — 3 in webhook (debug output), 5 in `toggleFavorite` action (user ID/role logging). `console.error` calls retained for legitimate error logging.
- **TipTap XSS pipeline verified safe** — pasted HTML in TipTap is preserved in the markdown body, but `sanitize-html` strips all dangerous elements (`<script>`, event handlers, `javascript:` URIs) at render time on the blog detail page. End-to-end safe.

### Known stock reservation limitations (not bugs — documented)
- **Seller manual restock during live session** — if a seller edits `stockQuantity` via the dashboard while a checkout session holds a reservation, the expired webhook adds back the reserved amount on top of the seller's manual value. Stock can exceed the seller's intended amount. Requires unusual seller + buyer timing.
- **Multi-seller cart partial failure** — if cart checkout creates sessions sequentially and seller B fails after seller A succeeded, seller A's stock is held for 31 minutes until session expiry. Buyer sees an error and cannot retry until expiry. Acceptable at launch volume.
- **Missed expired webhook** — if Stripe never delivers `checkout.session.expired` (outage, 3-day retry exhaustion), stock is permanently held. No self-healing cron exists. Mitigation: Stripe's webhook reliability is >99.99%. A nightly reconciliation cron could be added post-launch if this becomes an issue.
- **`cart/add` allows adding reserved-but-not-sold items** — a listing with all stock reserved (stockQuantity=0, status=ACTIVE) can still be added to cart. Checkout creation is the enforcement point, where the atomic SQL `WHERE stockQuantity >= qty` blocks the buyer.

## UI Polish — Emoji Removal + Fixes (2026-04-21)

### Emoji → Icons (80+ instances, 28 files)
All emoji replaced with SVG icon components from `src/components/icons/` or plain text:
- Dashboard stats `👁🖱♥🔔` → `Eye`/`Heart`/`Bell` icon components + "clicks" text
- Gift labels `🎁` → `Gift` icon; Shipping `🚚` → `Truck` icon
- Custom order `🎨🔨` → `Palette`/`Hammer` icons; Location `📍` → `MapPin` icon
- Decorative `🪵🪚🎉📢📋` → icon components or removed entirely
- Message snippets `🖼📄📎` → plain text ("Photo", "PDF", "Attachment")
- Error/404 pages → `Wrench`/`Logs` icons; Onboarding → `Hammer` icon
- Unicode characters `★☆✓✗✕•○` are NOT emoji — these were kept as-is

### Other UI fixes
- **Cart label**: "Grand total (items only)" → "Subtotal (items only)" (shipping not yet calculated at that step)
- **TipTap toolbar**: transaction listener forces re-render so `isActive()` reflects current state immediately after toggling bold/italic/etc.
- **ListingGallery mobile**: `style={{ height: "500px" }}` → `h-[350px] sm:h-[400px] md:h-[500px]`. Was portrait-cropping on mobile (500px tall × 375px wide).
- **Back buttons**: "Back to Sales" / "Back to Orders" links added to order detail pages
- **Refund button**: partial refund confirm changed from `bg-neutral-900` → `bg-red-600` (destructive action color match)
- **R2UploadButton**: error state added — shows user-facing error message on upload failure, clears on retry/success

## Local Pickup + Display Name Warning (2026-04-21)

### Local Pickup as a Shipping Option
- **Quote route** (`/api/shipping/quote`): injects "Local Pickup (Free)" as a synthetic $0 rate when `seller.allowLocalPickup === true`. HMAC-signed via `signRate()` with `objectId: "pickup"`. Shows first in the ShippingRateSelector radio list via `unshift`.
- **Checkout flow**: no changes needed. Buyer still enters address (Stripe requires it for tax calculation). The `$0` shipping rate flows through HMAC verification and Stripe session creation unchanged.
- **Webhook detection**: already handles pickup — `shippingTitle.toLowerCase().includes("pickup")` matches "Local Pickup (Free)" and sets `fulfillmentMethod: "PICKUP"`.
- **Fulfillment**: pickup orders follow the existing `ready_for_pickup → picked_up` status flow with notifications + emails (fixed earlier in this session).
- **Seller setup**: `allowLocalPickup` toggle in Shop Settings (`/dashboard/seller`). No new fields needed.

### Display Name Soft Uniqueness Warning
- **On save** (`/dashboard/profile` server action): case-insensitive `findFirst` checks for another seller with the same `displayName`. Save always proceeds (soft warning, not hard block).
- **UI**: if duplicate found, redirects to `?warning=duplicate-name`. Amber banner suggests adding location/specialty (e.g. "Oak & Iron Woodworks — Austin").
- **No DB constraint** — display names are not unique at the schema level. This is a UX nudge, not enforcement. Multiple sellers can still have identical names (like Etsy).

### Shipping options variability (documented, no fix needed)
- Shippo API returns live carrier rates that fluctuate in real-time. The `street1: "Placeholder"` in the quote route does not affect rate accuracy (rates are zip-to-zip based). Residential/commercial classification may be slightly off but is buyer-favorable. This is normal carrier API behavior, not a bug.

## Data Integrity & UX Fixes (2026-04-21)

### Security & data integrity
- **Map page** — added `vacationMode: false` + `user: { banned: false }` filters. Vacation/banned sellers no longer appear as map pins.
- **SellerRefundPanel** — hidden when the case already has `stripeRefundId` (admin refund). Prevents double-refund via the seller panel after admin already resolved.
- **Seller rating** — now includes private/custom listing reviews. Previous query filtered by public listing IDs only, excluding all custom work reviews from the seller's average. Changed to query by `listing.sellerId` directly.
- **Case API** — blocks case creation when `fulfillmentStatus === "PENDING"`. Buyers must wait until the order has shipped/been prepared.

### Display & count accuracy
- **Homepage maker count** — filters `chargesEnabled: true`, `vacationMode: false`, `user: { banned: false }`. Was counting all sellers with an ACTIVE listing including banned/vacation.
- **Sales list total** — uses `mySubtotalCents` (this seller's items only) instead of `order.itemsSubtotalCents` (all sellers). Was inflated for multi-seller orders.
- **"See all N pieces"** on seller profile — counts only ACTIVE + non-private listings. Was including SOLD/SOLD_OUT that buyers can't see on the shop page.
- **"In Stock · null available"** — fixed to show "In Stock" without count when `stockQuantity` is null.

### Seller dashboard
- **Guild badge revocation explanation** — both cron routes now update `MakerVerification.status` to `REJECTED`/`GUILD_MASTER_REJECTED` on revocation. Dashboard shows "Your Guild badge was revoked" banner with re-apply guidance.
- **Mark delivered** — button only visible when `fulfillmentStatus === "SHIPPED"` (was always visible regardless of status).
- **Mark sold** — only available from ACTIVE/SOLD_OUT (was allowing DRAFT → SOLD). Guard added to both dashboard and shop actions.
- **Inventory badges** — DRAFT, HIDDEN, Under Review, and Rejected listings now show status badges in the inventory view (were silently bucketed as "Active").
- **Restock HIDDEN → ACTIVE** — documented limitation: restocking always promotes to ACTIVE; seller must re-hide manually if the listing was previously HIDDEN.
- **displayName sanitization** — `sanitizeText()` applied on profile page (was already applied on seller settings page).

### Buyer experience
- **Cart unavailable items** — cart API now returns listing `status` and `sellerVacationMode`. Cart page shows inline warnings ("This item is no longer available" / "Maker is on vacation") and disables "Continue to shipping" when unavailable items are present.
- **Browse filter conflict** — `shipsFilter` no longer overwrites explicit `typeFilter`. Searching for `type=MADE_TO_ORDER&ships=3` no longer returns IN_STOCK results.

### Makers page
- **Zero-listing sellers excluded** — query now requires `listings: { some: { status: "ACTIVE", isPrivate: false } }`.
- **Banner image** — card image now uses `seller.bannerImageUrl` first, falling back to most recent listing photo, then placeholder. Was always using listing photo even when banner was set.

### Low-priority UX improvements
- **"Message Buyer"** — links to `/messages/new?to=buyerId` (was linking to inbox)
- **Inventory stale UI** — `router.refresh()` after stock save so status badges update immediately
- **Old orders $0.00** — fallback to `items.reduce(priceCents * quantity)` when subtotal fields are 0
- **Messages "Sent" tab** — renamed to "Awaiting Reply" (was misleading — filtered by "last message was mine")
- **Order item 404 links** — non-ACTIVE listings render as plain text instead of clickable links to deleted/hidden pages
- **Browse no-results featured** — added `chargesEnabled + vacationMode + banned` seller filters
- **Browse popular tags** — same seller safety filters added
- **About page "Become a Maker"** — links to `/sign-up` for signed-out users, `/dashboard` for signed-in
- **`sendWelcomeSeller`** — confirmed NOT dead code (called in Clerk webhook on `user.created`)
- **Multi-seller success page** — deferred. Only shows last seller's receipt. Fixing requires checkout flow refactor; other orders visible via "View my orders".

### Final homepage safety audit (2026-04-21)
- **Mosaic photo query** — added `seller: { chargesEnabled, vacationMode: false, banned: false }` (banned/vacation seller photos could appear in hero background)
- **Featured maker fallback SQL** — added SellerProfile + User JOINs with safety filters (banned most-reviewed seller could be featured in Meet a Maker spotlight)
- **From Your Makers** — added seller safety filters to both `recentListings` and `recentBlogPosts` queries

### Dead code identified (not removed — low priority)
- `src/app/actions/toggleFavorite.ts` — orphaned server action; `FavoriteButton` uses REST routes. Zero import sites.
- `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` — legacy single-item checkout was deleted in Phase 6. If this still exists, it's unreferenced dead code.

## Notification & Email Fixes (2026-04-21)

### Approval gating
- **Listing follower notifications** — gated on `finalListing.status === "ACTIVE"` after AI review. PENDING_REVIEW listings no longer trigger `FOLLOWED_MAKER_NEW_LISTING` notifications or emails. Previously, followers received notifications linking to 404 pages.
- **Blog comment notifications** — moved from POST handler (fires on creation with `approved: false`) to the `approveComment` server action in `src/app/admin/blog/page.tsx`. `NEW_BLOG_COMMENT` and `BLOG_COMMENT_REPLY` now fire only when an admin approves the comment.

### Notification dedup
- **Favorites** — `NEW_FAVORITE` notifications check for existing notification with same `type` + `link` within 24 hours before creating. Prevents spam on favorite/unfavorite toggle cycles.
- **Follows** — `NEW_FOLLOWER` notifications check for existing notification with same `type` + follower name within 24 hours. Prevents spam on follow/unfollow/refollow.

### Fulfillment notification matrix (complete)
| Action | Status | In-app notification | Email |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shipped` | SHIPPED | `ORDER_SHIPPED` to buyer | `sendOrderShipped` |
| `delivered` | DELIVERED | `ORDER_DELIVERED` to buyer | `sendOrderDelivered` (NEW) |
| `ready_for_pickup` | READY_FOR_PICKUP | `ORDER_SHIPPED` to buyer (NEW) | `sendReadyForPickup` |
| `picked_up` | PICKED_UP | `ORDER_DELIVERED` to buyer (NEW) | — |

### Other fixes
- **Staff case messages** — now notify both buyer AND seller (was buyer only). Staff role detected via `me.role`. Buyer link → `/dashboard/orders/`, seller link → `/dashboard/sales/`.
- **Seller refund notification** — `CASE_RESOLVED` notification sent to buyer with refund amount when seller issues a refund via `/api/orders/[id]/refund`.
- **Email subject escaping** — `safeSubject()` helper strips `<>"'&` from user names/titles in 6 email subjects.
- **Email img src escaping** — `safeImgUrl()` validates HTTPS + escapes quotes before inserting into `<img src>`.

## Scalability Optimizations (2026-04-18)

### Smart notification polling
`NotificationBell` uses adaptive polling instead of a fixed interval:
- **Active tab + recent activity**: poll every 60 seconds
- **Active tab + idle > 5 min**: poll every 5 minutes
- **Background tab** (`document.visibilityState === "hidden"`): poll every 15 minutes
- **Tab refocused**: immediate fetch + reschedule
- **Dropdown opened**: immediate fetch (unchanged)

Activity tracked via `lastActivityRef` (useRef, not state) — `mousemove`, `keydown`, `click` listeners with 10-second throttle. No re-renders on activity detection. The `setTimeout`-based scheduler reads the ref directly to determine the next interval.

### Homepage query deduplication
- `getBlockedIdsFor()` (new, `src/lib/blocks.ts`) returns both `blockedUserIds` (Set) and `blockedSellerIds` (string[]) in a single Block table query. Homepage previously called `getBlockedSellerProfileIdsFor()` + `getBlockedUserIdsFor()` separately, which queried the Block table twice per page load for logged-in users. Other pages that only need one set still use the individual functions.
- MapPoints query: added `take: 200` limit (was unlimited — serialized all opted-in sellers into the RSC payload). Added `user: { banned: false }` filter.

### Neon connection pooler
Documented in `prisma/schema.prisma`. `DATABASE_URL` should use Neon's pooled endpoint (`-pooler` suffix in hostname) for runtime. `DIRECT_URL` uses the direct endpoint for migrations (PgBouncer doesn't support DDL). Both configured in `prisma.config.ts`. Switch `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel env vars to the pooler endpoint — zero code changes needed.

### Pagination audit (2026-04-21)
Safety caps added to 12 previously unbounded `findMany` queries. These prevent full-table scans at scale without requiring full pagination UI:

| Page | Query | Cap |
|---|---|---|
| `dashboard/inventory` | Seller's IN_STOCK listings | `take: 100` |
| `messages` | Conversations inbox | `take: 50` |
| `dashboard/blog` | Author's blog posts | `take: 50` |
| `account/following` | Followed sellers | `take: 50` |
| `account/commissions` | Buyer's commission requests | `take: 30` |
| `account/blocked` | Blocked users | `take: 50` |
| `admin/reports` | Open reports | `take: 50` |
| `admin/blog` | All posts + pending comments | `take: 50` + `take: 30` |
| `admin/verification` | 4 application/member queries | `take: 50` each |
| `seller/[id]` profile | All seller listings | `take: 100` |
| `dashboard` | Saved searches | `take: 20` |

Already paginated (no change needed): `dashboard/sales` (PAGE_SIZE=25), `dashboard/notifications` (PAGE_SIZE=20), `dashboard/orders` (take:20), `admin/audit` (perPage), `admin/broadcasts` (pageSize), `account/saved` (PAGE_SIZE=24), `account/orders` (PAGE_SIZE=20), `browse` (paginated), `seller/shop` (paginated), `blog` (paginated), `admin/cases` (paginated), `admin/orders` (paginated), `admin/users` (paginated), `account/feed` (cursor-based).

Real pagination (PAGE_SIZE + Prev/Next) should be added per page as row counts grow past the safety caps.

### UTC timestamp fixes (2026-04-21)
5 server-side `toLocaleString()` calls replaced with `LocalDate` client component (renders in buyer/seller's local timezone instead of Vercel's UTC):
- `dashboard/sales/[orderId]` — order date, case message timestamps, pickup time
- `dashboard/sales` — order list date
- `checkout/success` — receipt date
- `dashboard/notifications` — notification timestamps

### Other fixes (2026-04-21)
- `checkout/success`: wrapped `stripe.checkout.sessions.retrieve` in try/catch — invalid/expired session_id redirects to `/cart` instead of showing error page
- Both checkout routes: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` fallback to `"https://thegrainline.com"` (prevents `undefined/checkout/success` URL on missing env var)

### Remaining Batch 2 items (not yet done)
- Fix `getSellerRatingMap` N+1 on homepage (single JOIN like browse page)
- Parallelize featured maker + seller ratings + logged-in user data queries

## Remaining Security Gaps

| `.env.save` / `.env.production` cleanup | ✅ Deleted (2026-04-18) — contained live secrets. Both were gitignored but sitting unencrypted on disk. |
| `SHIPPING_RATE_SECRET` in Preview | ✅ Complete (2026-04-18) — added via Vercel dashboard. Preview deploys can now run checkout flows. |
| Apple Pay domain registration | ✅ Complete (2026-04-18) — `thegrainline.com` added to Stripe Payment method domains |
| `www` redirect | ✅ Complete (2026-04-18) — 308 permanent redirect `www.thegrainline.com` → `thegrainline.com` in Vercel. SSL provisioned. |

### Security Maintenance Rules

**NEVER put secrets in CLAUDE.md or any tracked file.** This includes passwords, API keys, tokens, DSNs, connection strings, and secret values — even old/rotated ones. Referencing env var *names* (e.g. `SHIPPING_RATE_SECRET`) is fine; referencing their *values* is not. If a secret needs to be documented, write `[REDACTED]` and describe where to find it (e.g. "in Vercel env vars" or "in Neon dashboard"). This rule applies to all Claude Code output — never echo, log, grep for, or display credential values in conversation responses.

**Set-and-forget infrastructure** (already done — do not touch unless there's a breach):
- Upstash Redis rate limiters — `safeRateLimit` (fail-closed, used for mutations) vs `safeRateLimitOpen` (fail-open, used for analytics)
- Clerk security settings: bot protection, disposable email blocking, email subaddress blocking, strict enumeration protection, lockout policy
- `chargesEnabled` filter on all public listing queries — prevents ghost sellers
- Stripe `account.updated` and `account.application.deauthorized` webhook handlers

**Checklist for every new API route:**
1. Is it public? If no → add `auth()` as the first check, return 401 before any DB access
2. Add it to `isPublic` in `middleware.ts` only if truly auth-free
3. If it mutates state → add a rate limiter from `src/lib/ratelimit.ts` using `safeRateLimit` (all mutation routes now have rate limits)
4. If it accepts a request body → add a Zod schema at the top of the file
5. If it's public and mutates state → document why it's CSRF-safe in `src/lib/security.ts`

**CSP update procedure** (when adding a new third-party):
1. Add the domain to `next.config.ts` `securityHeaders` in the relevant directive
2. Deploy in report-only mode first; check Sentry for new violations
3. Once clean, enforce by changing `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` → `Content-Security-Policy`

**npm audit cadence**: Run `npm audit` after every major dependency upgrade. Fix moderate/high vulnerabilities unless they are in transitive deps with no available fix (document the reason in a comment). Do NOT run `npm audit fix --force`.

## Production Deployment

- **Live at**: [thegrainline.com](https://thegrainline.com) — deployed to Vercel, DNS via Cloudflare
- **Next.js** 16.2.4 (upgraded from 16.2.1 — CVE-2025-55182 + GHSA-q4gf-8mx6-v5v3)
- **Clerk** v7.2.3 (upgraded from 7.0.7 — GHSA-vqx2-fgx2-5wq9 middleware bypass fix)
- **Stripe SDK** 19.3 (explicit `apiVersion` removed — uses SDK default)
- **Prisma** 7.7.0 (upgraded from 7.6.0 via Dependabot)
- **React** 19.2.5, **@sentry/nextjs** 10.49, **maplibre-gl** 5.23, **resend** 6.12
- **All ESLint/build errors fixed** — zero `any` types, all `<a>` → `<Link>`, unescaped entities fixed, unused imports removed
- **Stripe webhook** fully working in test mode — root cause of prior failure was webhook registered in live mode while app uses test keys (`sk_test_`); fixed by importing the webhook destination into test mode via Stripe Workbench. All notifications confirmed working: NEW_ORDER, NEW_FAVORITE, NEW_MESSAGE, NEW_REVIEW, LOW_STOCK, ORDER_DELIVERED. Webhook handler updated to handle Workbench Snapshot thin-event format (detects thin payload by key count ≤ 3, retrieves full event via `stripe.events.retrieve`).
- **⚠️ Live mode webhook still needed** — when switching to live mode (after Stripe identity verification clears), register a new webhook destination in Stripe Dashboard → **Live mode** → Developers → Webhooks → `https://thegrainline.com/api/stripe/webhook`, then update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel with the live mode signing secret.
- **Stripe identity verification** submitted (2–3 business day review window as of 2026-03-27)
- **Clerk user sync webhook** built (`src/app/api/clerk/webhook/route.ts`); needs `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel + endpoint registered in Clerk dashboard (see Clerk User Sync Webhook section)
- **Email system** fully live — Resend domain verified for thegrainline.com (auto-configure), `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM` added to Vercel, DMARC record added to Cloudflare DNS. Buyer and seller order confirmation emails confirmed working. Spam deliverability being addressed via DMARC + domain reputation warmup.

## Auth & Middleware

Clerk v7 handles auth. Public routes (no login required): `/`, `/browse`, `/listing/*`, `/seller/*`, `/sellers/*`, `/map/*`, `/blog/*`, `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/api/whoami`, `/api/me`, `/api/reviews`, `/api/blog/*`, `/api/search/*`, `/api/stripe/webhook` (called by Stripe servers — no Clerk session), `/api/clerk/webhook` (called by Clerk servers — no Clerk session), `/api/uploadthing` (UploadThing callback). Protected routes (auth required): `/account`, `/account/orders`, `/dashboard/*`, `/cart`, `/checkout/*`, `/messages/*`, `/orders/*`. Everything else requires authentication.

**Clerk v7 component API** — `SignedIn`/`SignedOut` no longer exist; use `<Show when="signed-in">` / `<Show when="signed-out">` from `@clerk/nextjs`. The `fallback` prop on `Show` replaces paired `SignedOut` blocks. `afterSignOutUrl` is set on `<ClerkProvider>`, not `<UserButton>`. Any component using `useSearchParams()` must be inside a `<Suspense>` boundary.

Helper utilities:
- `src/lib/ensureUser.ts` — resolves Clerk session to a DB User
- `src/lib/ensureSeller.ts` — resolves Clerk session to a DB SellerProfile

## Payments

Stripe Connect is used so sellers receive payouts directly. Stripe webhook handler is at `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`. The `stripe` client lives in `src/lib/stripe.ts`.

**Platform fee: 5%** of item subtotal (excluding shipping and taxes), applied as `application_fee_amount` in all four checkout routes. Note: shipping cannot be included in fee because `application_fee_amount` is fixed at session creation and shipping amount depends on buyer's selection during checkout.

**CHECKOUT REBUILD — Phase 1 complete**: User model now has `shippingName`, `shippingLine1`, `shippingLine2`, `shippingCity`, `shippingState`, `shippingPostalCode`, `shippingPhone` fields (migration: `add_user_shipping_address`). `GET /api/account/shipping-address` returns saved address. `PUT /api/account/shipping-address` saves address (Zod validated: 2-letter state, 5-digit zip, sanitized text). Both routes auth-required, rate-limited via `shippingAddressRatelimit` (30/10min per userId).

**CHECKOUT REBUILD — Phase 2 complete**: `ShippingAddressForm` component at `src/components/ShippingAddressForm.tsx`. Loads saved address from `GET /api/account/shipping-address` on mount (signed-in users). 50-state `<select>` dropdown. Client-side field validation with inline error messages. "Save this address" checkbox (default on, signed-in only) — calls `PUT /api/account/shipping-address` best-effort on submit. Loading skeleton while fetching. Calls `onConfirm(address)` on valid submit.

**CHECKOUT REBUILD — Phase 3 complete**: `ShippingRateSelector` component at `src/components/ShippingRateSelector.tsx`. Fetches rates from `POST /api/shipping/quote` on mount for a given `sellerId` + `ShippingAddress`. Auto-selects cheapest rate. Renders selectable rate rows (radio button style, amber highlight on selected). Falls back to `FALLBACK_RATE` (`objectId="fallback"`) on error — non-blocking, parent handles gracefully. `src/types/checkout.ts` updated with `FALLBACK_RATE` constant and `isFallbackRate()` helper.

**CHECKOUT REBUILD — Phase 4 complete**: Cart page restructured into 3 steps: review → address (`ShippingAddressForm`) → payment (existing per-seller checkout buttons, pre-filled with confirmed address). Step indicator breadcrumb on all steps. URL state via `router.replace(?step=)` — browser back button exits cart (intentional; use in-page Back/Change buttons). Mount-time URL restoration with empty dep array (mount only, eslint-disable). Safety guard redirects to address if payment reached without address. `destBySeller` pre-filled in `onConfirm` callback — all 5 fields (`useCalculated: true`, `postal`, `state`, `city`, `country`) for all cart sellerIds. `renderSellerSections(showCheckoutButtons)` helper extracts shared seller section JSX — Step 1 shows items without checkout buttons, Step 3 shows items with checkout buttons + address summary header. Gift notes render inside per-seller sections on both steps. Existing checkout flow preserved end-to-end. Phase 5 next: update checkout-seller + single routes to accept selectedRate + return clientSecret; add ShippingRateSelector to Step 3; replace per-seller buttons with embedded checkout; set explicit transfer_data.amount + on_behalf_of.

**`on_behalf_of` REMOVED** (2026-04-15): was causing tax to flow to seller instead of platform. Removed from all 4 routes. Platform absorbs Stripe processing fees (~2.9% + 30¢) — covered by the 5% platform fee.

**Product tax code**: `txcd_99999999` (General - Tangible Personal Property) set on all product line items + gift wrapping. Was defaulting to `txcd_10000000` (Electronically Supplied Services — wrong for physical handmade goods).

**CHECKOUT REBUILD — Phase 5 complete** (2026-04-16):
- `checkout-seller` route rewritten: new payload schema (`shippingAddress` + `selectedRate` objects), `ui_mode: "embedded"`, returns `clientSecret`, explicit `transfer_data.amount` excludes tax (items + shipping + giftwrap - 5% fee), `on_behalf_of` intentionally deferred (fee allocation decision pending Terms update), `automatic_tax` with `liability: { type: "self" }`
- `shipping_address_collection` removed from checkout-seller — address collected in cart UI
- Webhook: `reverseTaxIfNeeded` removed (no longer needed — explicit `transfer_data.amount` retains tax on platform automatically). Address now read from session metadata with fallback to Stripe fields for legacy sessions. Per-seller cart cleanup added AFTER `$transaction` (non-fatal).
- CSP updated: `checkout.stripe.com` added to `frame-src` and `connect-src` (required for embedded checkout iframe)
- Quote route: falls back to cart lookup by `userId` when `cartId` absent; now returns Shippo `objectId` per rate
- `ShippingRateSelector`: real `objectId` preferred, `AbortController` on fetch, `useCallback` removed
- `EmbeddedCheckoutPanel` component created (`src/components/EmbeddedCheckoutPanel.tsx`)
- Cart page: 4-step flow (review/address/shipping/payment), `destBySeller` removed, `selectedRates` + `clientSecrets` state added, `sessionStorage` backup for payment step, multi-seller sequential payment via embedded checkout
- `/api/cart/checkout/single` NOT updated (Phase 6 — `BuyNowButton.tsx` still calls it with old payload)
- New Order fields: `quotedToName String?`, `quotedToPhone String?` (migration: `add_order_quoted_to_name_phone`)
- Historical fields retained: `taxReversalId`, `taxReversalAmountCents` (no longer written)
- ENV required: `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- Post-deploy fixes: `checkoutRatelimit` rate limiter restored; Sentry capture in catch block; `setSelectedRates({})` on "Change" button in Step 3; `redirect_on_completion: "if_required"` so `onComplete` fires for card payments; `onComplete` extracts session ID from last client secret (`split("_secret_")[0]`) and redirects to `/checkout/success?session_id=...`
- **Success page now distinguishes embedded vs hosted checkout** via `taxRetainedAtCreation` metadata flag (`"true"` on all Phase 5 embedded sessions). **Embedded sessions**: single re-query for webhook-created order; friendly "Payment successful! 🎉 Your order is being processed and will appear in your orders momentarily." fallback with "View my orders" + "Keep shopping" buttons if webhook hasn't fired yet; **NO fallback `order.create`** (webhook is the authoritative order creator for embedded flow, and racing it causes P2002 unique-constraint errors on `stripeSessionId`). **Hosted sessions** (legacy Buy Now / `/api/checkout`): existing fallback order creation preserved with P2002 try/catch so webhook race still resolves to the webhook-created order. Final behavior: (1) order found on first query → full receipt in both flows; (2) embedded + found on second query → full receipt; (3) embedded + still not found → "Payment successful" message; (4) hosted + not found → fallback create with P2002 catch → full receipt.
- **Fixed shipping receipt display** — success page and Stripe webhook both now use `s.shipping_cost?.amount_subtotal` (pre-tax) instead of `amount_total` when writing `Order.shippingAmountCents`. `amount_total` includes tax on shipping which is already counted in the tax line, causing the receipt to double-count shipping tax.
- **Fixed order timestamp display** — new `src/components/LocalDate.tsx` (`"use client"`) renders `new Date(date).toLocaleString()` on the client so buyer's browser timezone is used. Server components (like `/dashboard/orders` and `/dashboard/orders/[id]`) otherwise run `toLocaleString()` in the server's timezone (UTC on Vercel), displaying stale/wrong times. Applied to order createdAt, pickupReadyAt, and case message timestamps.
- Phase 6 next: Buy Now modal + checkout/single update

**CHECKOUT REBUILD — Phase 6 complete** (2026-04-16):
- `BuyNowCheckoutModal` (`src/components/BuyNowCheckoutModal.tsx`): new 3-step modal (Address → Shipping → Payment) reusing `ShippingAddressForm`, `ShippingRateSelector`, `EmbeddedCheckoutPanel`, `GiftNoteSection`. Sign-in gate on button click (redirects to `/sign-in?redirect_url=`). Payment state resets on close (address + rate preserved for quick re-open; `clientSecret` nulled because Stripe session expires). Escape key + backdrop click close handlers. Order summary shows items + shipping; tax shown as "Calculated at payment".
- `BuyNowButton` (`src/components/BuyNowButton.tsx`): thin wrapper — click opens modal via `useState`; uses `useUser()` from Clerk for sign-in check. Old inline ZIP/state form removed entirely. New required props: `listingTitle`, `listingImageUrl`, `sellerName`, `sellerId`, `priceCents`; optional `quantity`, `offersGiftWrapping`, `giftWrappingPriceCents`.
- `/api/cart/checkout/single` rewritten: new Zod payload (`shippingAddress` + `selectedRate` nested objects matching cart route), `ui_mode: "embedded"`, `redirect_on_completion: "if_required"`, explicit `transfer_data.amount = itemsSubtotal + shipping + giftWrap − 5% platformFee` (excludes tax — platform retains tax), returns `{ clientSecret }`. `taxRetainedAtCreation: "true"` metadata flag set. Sentry import added. Preserves rate limiter, `chargesEnabled` pre-flight guard, `statement_descriptor_suffix` derivation. Removed `shipping_address_collection`, `billing_address_collection`, `application_fee_amount`, `success_url`/`cancel_url`, old Shippo re-quote logic, old `to*` Zod fields. Fallback rate: if buyer picks `isFallbackRate(selectedRate)` (objectId `"fallback"`), reads `SiteConfig.fallbackShippingCents` (default $15) for the transfer calculation.
- `ShippingRateSelector`: added `quoteBodyExtra?: Record<string, string>` prop for single-item mode (Buy Now passes `{ mode: "single", listingId }`). `quoteBodyStr = JSON.stringify(…)` stable dep for `useEffect`. Cart call site unchanged (omits prop → default cart behavior preserved).
- Legacy routes deleted: `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` (entire directory removed) and `src/app/api/cart/checkout/route.ts`. Zero UI callers confirmed before deletion. Preserved: `/api/cart/checkout/single` (Buy Now) and `/api/cart/checkout-seller` (cart).
- Webhook: no change needed — both paths (cart + listingId) already write `quotedToName` and `quotedToPhone` from Phase 5.
- Quote route: no change needed — single-mode branch already returns `objectId` per rate (Phase 5 unified mapping).
- Listing page (`src/app/listing/[id]/page.tsx`): only call site updated with new props; no Prisma query change (seller fields already fully included via `seller: { include: { user: true } }`).
- Phase 7 deferred: `on_behalf_of` (Terms update needed), Apple Pay domain registration, billing address prefill (Stripe Customer objects).

**Security fixes post-Phase 6** (2026-04-16):
- `checkout/single` reads gift wrap price from `listing.seller.giftWrappingPriceCents` (server-side), no longer accepts client input for this field. `giftWrappingPriceCents` removed from `CheckoutSingleSchema` and from `BuyNowCheckoutModal` fetch body. Prevents buyer from paying $0 gift wrap while seller's real price is charged downstream.
- Listing status/privacy guards added to `checkout/single`: rejects with 400 if `listing.status !== "ACTIVE"` (blocks DRAFT, SOLD, SOLD_OUT, HIDDEN, PENDING_REVIEW, REJECTED); rejects with 400 if `listing.isPrivate && listing.reservedForUserId !== me.id` (blocks direct-POST purchase of custom/reserved listings). Note: `Listing.soldAt` and `isPublished` fields do not exist in the schema — `status === "SOLD"` is covered by the ACTIVE-only check.
- `BuyNowButton`: `isLoaded` gate (`useUser()` → `{ isSignedIn, isLoaded }`) with `disabled={!isLoaded}` on the button element. Prevents Clerk hydration race where `isSignedIn` is briefly `undefined` and signed-in users get redirected to `/sign-in` if they click immediately on page load.

**Phase 6.5 — HMAC-signed shipping rate tokens + security parity** (2026-04-16):
- `src/lib/shipping-token.ts`: `signRate()` + `verifyRate()` using HMAC-SHA256. `timingSafeEqual` for comparison (not `===`, which is a timing-attack footgun). Expiry checked BEFORE HMAC compute. Canonical field-ordered input string `${objectId}:${amountCents}:${displayName}:${carrier}:${estDays}:${contextId}:${buyerPostal}:${expiresAt}` (no `JSON.stringify` — key ordering not guaranteed stable across refactors). 30-min TTL. Fails loud if `SHIPPING_RATE_SECRET` is missing.
- `/api/shipping/quote`: signs each rate with `contextId` (sellerId for cart, listingId for buy-now) and `buyerPostal`. **`toPostal` is now required** (tightened Zod from `.optional().nullable()` to `.min(1).max(20)`) — the "10001" NYC default was removed because it would cause every signature to mismatch at checkout verification. Rate response adds `token` + `expiresAt` fields.
- `src/types/checkout.ts`: `SelectedShippingRate` gains `token: string` + `expiresAt: number`. `FALLBACK_RATE` updated with `token: "fallback"` + `expiresAt: 0` (intentionally invalid HMAC; bypassed via `isFallbackRate()` before `verifyRate()` is called).
- Both checkout routes (`/api/cart/checkout-seller` and `/api/cart/checkout/single`): `verifyRate()` called after Zod parsing and before Stripe session creation. Fallback rates bypass verification via `isFallbackRate()` and use `SiteConfig.fallbackShippingCents` instead of the client-provided amount. `contextId` is `body.sellerId` in checkout-seller and `body.listingId` in checkout/single (concrete `const`, NOT `??` fallback — TypeScript catches misuse).
- **Security parity for `checkout-seller`**: the same gift-wrap, status, and isPrivate fixes that were applied to checkout/single are now applied here. Server-side gift wrap price from `sellerItems[0].listing.seller.giftWrappingPriceCents` (client input removed from Zod). `offersGiftWrapping` guard (400 reject). `status !== "ACTIVE"` guard per cart item (blocks DRAFT, SOLD, SOLD_OUT, HIDDEN, PENDING_REVIEW, REJECTED). `isPrivate && reservedForUserId !== me.id` guard per cart item.
- **`checkout/single`**: `offersGiftWrapping` guard added (400 reject). `offersGiftWrapping` added to seller select.
- `ShippingRateSelector`: `QuoteRate` type gains optional `token`/`expiresAt`. `toSelectedRate` uses `r.token ?? ""` (NOT `?? "fallback"`) — unsigned rates fail HMAC verification loudly with 400, rather than silently downgrading to `SiteConfig.fallbackShippingCents` via `isFallbackRate()` match. Failure is a surfaced bug, not a silent price change.
- **ENV**: `SHIPPING_RATE_SECRET` (server-only, 64 hex chars). Set in Vercel Production and Development. Preview requires manual dashboard setup (CLI required git-branch scoping). Secret rotation invalidates all outstanding tokens; in-flight buyers see "Shipping rates have expired" error (30-min max impact window). `.env.example` committed with placeholder (gitignore exception added: `!.env.example`).
- Status codes: 422 "Unprocessable Entity" for expired tokens (semantically correct), 400 for tampered/invalid tokens.

**Statement descriptor suffix**: all 4 routes add `statement_descriptor_suffix` from seller displayName (uppercase, alphanumeric, max 22 chars). Conditional spread — skipped if empty to prevent checkout breakage. Shows seller name on buyer's card statement to reduce chargebacks.

**Pre-flight chargesEnabled guard** (added 2026-04-15): all four checkout routes verify `seller.chargesEnabled && seller.stripeAccountId` BEFORE calling `stripe.checkout.sessions.create()`. Returns 400 "seller not accepting orders" if incomplete.

All four checkout routes:
- `src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` — legacy single item
- `src/app/api/cart/checkout/route.ts` — cart (single-seller enforced)
- `src/app/api/cart/checkout-seller/route.ts` — per-seller cart split
- `src/app/api/cart/checkout/single/route.ts` — single item from cart (buy-now)

Terms page (`/terms`) reflects 5% in sections 4.5 and 6.2.

**Automatic tax**: `automatic_tax: { enabled: true }` on all four routes. Tax stays with platform per Stripe marketplace facilitator default (no explicit `transfer_data.amount` — Stripe auto-excludes tax from seller transfer).

**chargesEnabled enforcement** (audited 2026-04-15): all paths that can make a listing public check `seller.chargesEnabled`:
- `publishListingAction` (shop) — returns error
- `createListing` (new listing) — redirects to error
- Edit re-review (`dashboard/listings/[id]/edit`) — reverts listing to DRAFT if seller lost chargesEnabled
- Photo add re-review (`api/listings/[id]/photos`) — same DRAFT revert
- All four checkout routes — pre-flight guard returns 400

### Seller Location & Map Opt-In (complete — 2026-04-03)
- **`SellerLocationSection.tsx`** — `"use client"` component; fully controlled checkbox state; wraps `LocationPicker` + `publicMapOptIn` checkbox
- **Privacy**: sellers with radius > 0 show approximate circle on seller/listing pages; cannot appear on makers map — checkbox force-unchecked and disabled with amber warning when `miles > 0`
- **Server action** enforces `radiusMeters = 0` when `publicMapOptIn = true` (unchanged at lines 53–58 of `dashboard/seller/page.tsx`)
- `dashboard/seller/page.tsx`: `LocationPicker` + inline checkbox replaced with `<SellerLocationSection>`

### Stripe Connect Dashboard Access (complete — 2026-04-01)
- **`POST /api/stripe/connect/login-link`** — seller auth required; calls `stripe.accounts.createLoginLink(stripeAccountId)`; returns `{ url }` for one-time Express dashboard link; opens in new tab
- **`StripeLoginButton`** (`src/app/dashboard/seller/StripeLoginButton.tsx`) — `"use client"`; renders "Go to Stripe Dashboard →" button when `hasStripeAccount=true`; handles loading/error states
- **`StripeConnectButton`** (`src/app/dashboard/seller/StripeConnectButton.tsx`) — `"use client"`; calls `POST /api/stripe/connect/create` with `returnUrl: "/dashboard/seller"`; works for sellers who skipped Stripe during onboarding; replaces static `<a href="/dashboard/onboarding">` link
- **"Payouts & Banking" section** on `/dashboard/seller`: three-state logic using both `chargesEnabled` and `stripeAccountId`: (1) both present → "✓ Stripe Connected" + `StripeLoginButton` + draft prompt; (2) `stripeAccountId` present but `chargesEnabled` false → "⚠ Stripe setup incomplete" + `StripeConnectButton` to resume; (3) neither → "Connect Stripe" + `StripeConnectButton` to start. `chargesEnabled` is the source of truth for full connection — `stripeAccountId` alone is insufficient (`stripeAccountId` is set when onboarding starts; `chargesEnabled` only becomes true when Stripe webhook confirms the account on `account.updated`)
- **Draft prompt** shown in fully-connected state when `draftCount > 0` — amber card with count and link to `/dashboard/inventory`
- **`/dashboard/seller` page title** changed from "Seller Profile" → "Shop Settings"

### Listing Visibility Rules (complete — 2026-04-02)
- **Listing detail page** (`/listing/[id]`) — returns 404 for non-connected sellers (`!listing.seller.chargesEnabled`) unless the viewer is the seller themselves (checked via `listing.seller.user?.clerkId === userId`)
- **Preview bypass** (`?preview=1`) — if `preview=1` AND the authenticated user is the listing's own seller (`listing.seller.user?.clerkId === userId`), all visibility/chargesEnabled/block checks are skipped and the listing renders normally regardless of status. An amber banner reads "Preview mode — this is how your listing appears to buyers. It is not yet published." Dashboard shows "Preview →" link for DRAFT/HIDDEN/PENDING_REVIEW listings opening in a new tab.
- **`generateMetadata`** returns `robots: { index: false, follow: false }` for non-connected seller listings — prevents Google from indexing them
- **All public surfaces filter `chargesEnabled: true`**: browse, homepage, similar items, search suggestions (Prisma + raw SQL), sitemap — listings from non-connected sellers are completely private to the seller only

Cart checkout supports multi-seller orders (splits into separate Stripe sessions per seller) and single-item buy-now.

## Shipping

Shippo integration (`src/lib/shippo.ts`) provides live rate quotes and label generation. Sellers can configure flat-rate or calculated shipping. Package dimensions are stored per listing and per seller profile (defaults). Packing logic is in `src/lib/packing.ts`.

`shippoRatesMultiPiece` returns `{ shipmentId, rates[] }`. Each rate includes `objectId` (the Shippo rate object ID). Both checkout routes (`checkout-seller` and `checkout/single`) pass `shipmentId` through Stripe session metadata and embed each rate's `objectId` in `shipping_rate_data.metadata`. The Stripe webhook reads these back and writes `shippoShipmentId` and `shippoRateObjectId` to the `Order` record, enabling label purchase later without re-quoting.

When Shippo returns no usable rates, `checkout/single` falls back to `SiteConfig.fallbackShippingCents` (default $15.00). The `checkout-seller` route falls back to the seller's flat-rate / pickup options.

## Maps (Maplibre GL)

All maps use Maplibre GL JS v5 with OpenFreeMap tiles (free, no API key, OpenStreetMap data). Migration from Leaflet complete 2026-04-03.

### Components
- `MaplibreMap.tsx` — single pin display map; `LeafletMap.tsx` re-exports it for backward compat
- `SellersMap.tsx` — multiple seller pins with popups
- `AllSellersMap.tsx` — full map with built-in GeoJSON clustering (no plugin needed)
- `MakersMapSection.tsx` — wrapper with geolocation button; wraps `AllSellersMap`
- `MapCard.tsx` — single pin or radius circle; privacy jitter via seeded PRNG preserved verbatim; accepts `className` prop
- `LocationPicker.tsx` — interactive draggable marker + address search via Nominatim

### Tile Provider
OpenFreeMap: `https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/liberty`
Free, no API key, no usage limits, OSM data

### Attribution
Maplibre automatically shows © OpenStreetMap contributors bottom-right. Legally required, cannot be removed.

### Key implementation notes
- `getClusterExpansionZoom`: Promise-based (v5 API) — use async/await NOT callback style
- `clusterId` cast: `features[0].properties?.cluster_id as number`
- `LocationPicker`: `map.panTo()` in both click and dragend handlers so viewport follows marker
- `LocationPicker` `drawCircle`: takes map as explicit parameter to avoid TypeScript closure narrowing
- `LocationPicker` radius circle: `map.once("idle", () => drawCircle(map))` fallback if style not yet loaded
- `LocationPicker`: accepts `onMilesChange?: (miles: number) => void` — fires on range slider change
- `LocationPicker`: marker hidden (`display: none`) when `meters > 0` — circle replaces pin for privacy
- `MapCard`: `scrollZoom.disable()` + `NavigationControl` — pannable/zoomable, no scroll hijack
- `MapCard`: `className` prop with default `"h-48 w-full rounded-xl border overflow-hidden"`
- `MapCard` jitter: `xmur3`/`mulberry32`/`seededRand`/`jitterAround` copied verbatim from Leaflet version
- `AllSellersMap`: unclustered sellers rendered as `Marker` pins; rebuilt on `sourcedata` + `moveend` (NOT render loop); deduplication via `Set<string>` to handle tile boundary duplicates; cleanup removes all markers before `map.remove()`
- `MakersMapSection`: `AllSellersMap` container wrapped in `rounded-2xl overflow-hidden`
- Maplibre popup global CSS in `globals.css`: `border-radius: 10px`, `padding: 12px 14px`, `box-shadow`, `font-family: inherit`
- Makers map queries (`/page.tsx` homepage + `/map/page.tsx`) require `chargesEnabled: true` — sellers without Stripe connected do not appear on the map even if they opted in

### Migration from Leaflet
Removed: `leaflet`, `react-leaflet`, `@types/leaflet`
Added: `maplibre-gl`
Clustering: native GeoJSON source `cluster: true` — no `leaflet.markercluster` plugin needed
Radius circles: GeoJSON Polygon 64-point approximation
CSP: removed `unpkg.com` from both `script-src-elem` and `connect-src`; added `https://tiles.openfreemap.org` to `connect-src`

## File Uploads (Cloudflare R2)

Files upload directly from browser to Cloudflare R2 via presigned URLs — no server bottleneck, zero egress fees. UploadThing (`uploadthing`, `@uploadthing/react`) removed as of 2026-04-02.

### Architecture
- `POST /api/upload/presign` — auth required; Zod-validates type/size/count; returns presigned PUT URL + public URL; generates key: `{endpoint}/{userId}/{timestamp}-{random}.{ext}`
- Browser PUTs file directly to R2 using the presigned URL
- `src/lib/r2.ts` — R2 S3-compatible client (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`)
- `src/hooks/useR2Upload.ts` — upload hook; uploads files sequentially; returns `UploadedFile[]` with both `url` and `ufsUrl` fields (`ufsUrl` is alias for `url` — backward compat with 13 consumer components that access `file.ufsUrl`)
- `src/components/R2UploadButton.tsx` — drop-in `UploadButton` replacement; handles `content.button` as ReactNode or render function `({ ready }) => ReactNode`; accepts `onUploadProgress`, `appearance.allowedContent` for backward compat
- `src/utils/uploadthing.ts` — re-exports R2 equivalents under old UploadThing names; 11 of 13 consumers needed zero changes
- `src/components/ReviewPhotosPicker.tsx` — updated to use `useR2Upload` directly (old `useUploadThing` positional-arg signature incompatible)

### Endpoints
| Endpoint | Max size | Max count |
|---|---|---|
| `listingImage` | 8MB | 8 |
| `messageImage` | 8MB | 6 |
| `messageFile` (PDF) | 8MB | 4 |
| `messageAny` | 8MB | 6 |
| `reviewPhoto` | 8MB | 6 |
| `listingVideo` | 128MB | 1 |
| `bannerImage` | 4MB | 1 |
| `galleryImage` | 4MB | 10 |

### R2 CORS Policy
Must be set in Cloudflare R2 bucket settings → CORS Policy:
```json
[{ "AllowedOrigins": ["https://thegrainline.com", "http://localhost:3000"], "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "GET"], "AllowedHeaders": ["Content-Type", "Content-Length"], "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600 }]
```

### Environment Variables
`CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL`

### Database migration (one-time, after deploy)
```
npx dotenv-cli -e .env.local -- npx ts-node --transpile-only scripts/migrate-uploadthing-to-r2.ts
```
Clears UploadThing URLs from: seller profile images, listing photos, review photos, blog post covers, commission reference images. Does NOT touch `User.imageUrl` (Clerk avatar URLs).

## npm audit status (2026-04-02)

All UploadThing-related vulnerabilities resolved — `uploadthing` and `@uploadthing/react` removed. `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities.

## Prisma 7 Migration (complete — 2026-03-31)

Upgraded from Prisma 6.16.2 → 7.6.0. Zero TypeScript errors; zero build errors.

### Breaking changes in Prisma 7

`url` and `directUrl` properties are no longer supported in the `datasource` block of `schema.prisma`. Database connection is now split:
- **Migrations/introspection**: defined in `prisma.config.ts` via `defineConfig({ datasource: { url } })`
- **Runtime client**: passed via a `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter to `new PrismaClient({ adapter })`

### Files changed

**`prisma/schema.prisma`** — removed `url` and `directUrl` from datasource:
```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
}
```

**`prisma.config.ts`** (new) — migration/introspection URL (uses `DIRECT_URL` for direct connection, falls back to `DATABASE_URL`):
```ts
import { defineConfig } from "prisma/config"
export default defineConfig({
  datasource: {
    url: process.env.DIRECT_URL ?? process.env.DATABASE_URL ?? "",
  },
})
```

**`src/lib/db.ts`** — now creates a `PrismaPg` adapter with the pooled `DATABASE_URL` and passes it to `PrismaClient`:
```ts
import { PrismaPg } from "@prisma/adapter-pg"
const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL! })
export const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter, log: [...] })
```

**New package**: `@prisma/adapter-pg` + `pg` + `@types/pg` added to dependencies.

### No query API changes
`findUnique`, `findFirst`, `findMany` and all other query methods behave identically in Prisma 7. The 347 query call sites needed no changes.

## CI/CD

**CI pipeline**: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push to `main` and every PR:
1. `npm ci` (clean install)
2. `npx prisma generate` (required before tsc — Prisma 7.7 client generation)
3. `npx tsc --noEmit` (type check — blocks PR on failure)
4. `npm audit` (informational, `continue-on-error: true` — does not block)

**Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`): weekly PRs every Monday for npm minor/patch updates. Major version bumps are ignored (require manual review). Minor/patch updates are grouped into a single PR. Limit: 10 open PRs.

**Deployment**: `npx vercel --prod` from the CLI. For schema migrations: always run `npx dotenv-cli -e .env -- npx prisma migrate deploy` BEFORE `vercel --prod`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server
npm run build      # Production build (runs prisma generate first)
npm run lint       # ESLint
npx prisma migrate dev   # Apply a new migration (uses prisma.config.ts for DB URL)
npx prisma studio        # Open Prisma Studio
```

## Homepage Visual Updates (2026-04-03)

### Amber warmth pass
Full amber color pass on `src/app/page.tsx`:
- Hero gradient: `from-amber-100 via-amber-50 to-stone-50` (richer amber start)
- Stats bar: `bg-amber-50` with `text-amber-300` separator dots
- Map section: `bg-amber-50/40`
- Category tiles: `bg-amber-50 border-amber-100 text-amber-700`
- Browse-all tile: `bg-amber-50/50 border-amber-200`
- Meet a Maker section: `bg-amber-50/60 border border-amber-100`
- Main content area wrapped in `bg-gradient-to-b from-amber-50/20 via-white to-white`

Also applied amber gradient to browse (`src/app/browse/page.tsx`) and listing detail (`src/app/listing/[id]/page.tsx`) pages: `bg-gradient-to-b from-amber-100/60 via-amber-50/30 to-white min-h-screen` on both `<main>` elements.

### Hero photo mosaic (merged to main — 2026-04-03)

**New component**: `src/components/HeroMosaic.tsx` — `"use client"` dual-row infinite scroll background mosaic:
- Row 1 scrolls left (`animate-scroll-left`), Row 2 scrolls right (`animate-scroll-right`)
- Photos duplicated for seamless CSS loop (`[...row1Base, ...row1Base]` at `width: 200%`)
- `blur-[4px] scale-105` on each photo for soft background effect
- `gap-px` between photos (no visible gap)
- **Overlay layers** (z-order from bottom up):
  1. Light warm amber overlay: `from-amber-900/20 via-amber-800/10 to-amber-900/20` (z-10)
  2. Top fade (h-32): `from-white/50 to-transparent` — blends into header (z-20)
  3. Bottom fade (h-24): `from-[#F7F5F0]/60 to-transparent` — blends into stats bar (z-20)
- Photos rendered as `tabIndex={-1} aria-hidden="true"` links (decorative, not navigable)

**CSS animations** added to `src/app/globals.css`:
```css
@keyframes scroll-left  { 0% { transform: translateX(0); }    100% { transform: translateX(-50%); } }
@keyframes scroll-right { 0% { transform: translateX(-50%); } 100% { transform: translateX(0); } }
.animate-scroll-left  { animation: scroll-left  40s linear infinite; }
.animate-scroll-right { animation: scroll-right 40s linear infinite; }
```

**Homepage data fetch** (`src/app/page.tsx`): 7th `Promise.all` query fetches 16 most recent ACTIVE non-private listings (`orderBy: { createdAt: "desc" }`), selecting `id` + first photo `url`. CDN URLs filtered (`cdn.thegrainline.com` only). Threshold: ≥12 real photos required to activate mosaic; falls back to amber gradient below that.

**Adaptive hero**: when mosaic active, hero section is `bg-[#1C1C1A]` (espresso), `min-h-[60vh]` (shorter than before — removed `min-h-screen`); h1, p, tags, and CTAs switch to white/glass variants. The "Browse the Workshop" CTA uses white text on dark background; "Find Makers Near You" becomes a white-bordered ghost button.

**Glass `SearchBar` variant**: `SearchBar` accepts `variant?: "default" | "glass"` prop. Glass variant: `bg-white/15 backdrop-blur-sm border-white/40`, white text + placeholder, submit button `bg-white/20`. Passed as `<SearchBar variant={mosaicPhotos.length >= 12 ? "glass" : "default"} />` in hero.

**Header**: `bg-white` → `bg-gradient-to-b from-amber-50 to-white` for subtle warmth on all pages.

## Bad Word Filter (complete — 2026-04-21)

`src/lib/profanity.ts` — simple word-list profanity filter using whole-word `\b` regex boundaries. Prevents false positives like "class" matching "ass" or "passionate" matching "ass".

- **`containsProfanity(text)`** — returns `{ flagged: boolean; matches: string[] }`
- **Log-only** — does not block submissions; logs `console.error("[PROFANITY] ...")` with matched words
- **Word list**: common profanity, slurs (racial, homophobic, ableist), sexual terms, harassment phrases ("kill yourself", "kys")
- **Applied to 4 routes** (after Zod parse, before DB create):
  1. `POST /api/reviews` — checks `comment` text
  2. `POST /api/blog/[slug]/comments` — checks `body` text
  3. `POST /api/commission` — checks `title + description`
  4. `POST /api/reviews/[id]/reply` — checks seller reply text

## Seller Preferred Carriers (complete — 2026-04-21)

Sellers can restrict shipping quotes to specific carriers.

### Schema
- **`SellerProfile.preferredCarriers String[] @default([])`** — list of preferred carrier names (e.g. `["UPS", "USPS"]`); empty = show all carriers
- Migration: `20260421232433_add_preferred_carriers`

### Seller settings UI (`/dashboard/seller`)
- "Preferred carriers" checkbox group (UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL) added below the "Use calculated shipping" toggle in the Shipping & Tax section
- Helper text: "Only show rates from selected carriers. Leave all unchecked to show all available carriers."
- Server action reads `formData.getAll("preferredCarriers")` and saves to profile

### Quote route filtering (`POST /api/shipping/quote`)
- `preferredCarriers` added to seller select in both cart and single mode queries
- Carrier filter applied to raw Shippo rates BEFORE the `.map()` that signs them (before HMAC signing, so filtered rates never get signed unnecessarily)
- Uses case-insensitive `.includes()` matching (e.g. "usps" matches "USPS" in carrier name)
- Local pickup option always passes through regardless of carrier preferences

## Reporting & Admin Email (2026-04-21)

### Report buttons on reviews and blog comments
- **Reviews** — `BlockReportButton` added to each review in `ReviewsSection.tsx` with `targetType: "REVIEW"`. Gated on `meId !== reviewer.id` (can't report your own review). Positioned after the date.
- **Blog comments** — `BlockReportButton` added to top-level comments in `blog/[slug]/page.tsx` and L2/L3 replies in `BlogReplyToggle.tsx` with `targetType: "BLOG_COMMENT"`. `BlogReplyToggle` accepts new `meId` prop.
- **Report labels** — `BlockReportButton` now shows "Report this review" and "Report this comment" for the new target types.
- **Admin reports** — batch-resolves `REVIEW` → `listingId` and `BLOG_COMMENT` → post `slug` for contextual links ("View listing" / "View post") in the admin reports queue.

### Reporting coverage (complete)
| Surface | targetType | Component |
|---|---|---|
| Seller profiles | `SELLER` | `BlockReportButton` on `/seller/[id]` |
| Listings | `LISTING` | `BlockReportButton` on `/listing/[id]` |
| Message threads | `MESSAGE_THREAD` | `BlockReportButton` in `/messages/[id]` |
| Reviews | `REVIEW` | `BlockReportButton` in `ReviewsSection` |
| Blog comments | `BLOG_COMMENT` | `BlockReportButton` in blog detail + `BlogReplyToggle` |

### Admin email to any user
- **`AdminEmailForm`** — accepts optional `defaultTo` (pre-fills email) and `defaultOpen` (auto-expands) props. Renders a "To" email input when no `userId` is provided.
- **Admin email API** — Zod schema now accepts `userId` OR `email` (refined: at least one required). Handles both lookup paths.
- **Admin users page** — "Email" link per user row navigates to `?email=user@example.com`. Standalone `AdminEmailForm` renders at the top of the page when the email param is present, auto-opened with pre-filled recipient.

## UX Fixes Batch — Order Management, Blog, Counts (2026-04-21)

### Order management
- **SellerNotesForm** (`src/components/SellerNotesForm.tsx`) — new client component replaces raw HTML form POST for order notes. Uses `fetch()` with "Saving..." / "Saved!" feedback. Keeps text in textarea after save (persistent notes).
- **Carrier dropdown** — replaced free-text carrier input with `<select>` (UPS, USPS, FedEx, DHL, Other). Eliminates case sensitivity issues and typos.
- **OrderTimeline refund step** — when `sellerRefundId` exists, a "Refund issued" step with a red dot and the refund amount is appended to the timeline. Applied to both buyer and seller order detail pages.
- **Review images in admin** — admin reviews page and account reviews page now query and display review photo thumbnails.

### Blog
- **Featured blog card image** — `h-56` → `aspect-[16/9]` for consistent proportions on mobile.
- **SaveBlogButton on homepage** — added to each blog card in "Stories from the Workshop" section. Saved state queried via `SavedBlogPost` for signed-in users.
- **SaveBlogButton on featured blog card** — added to the featured post card on `/blog`.

### Counts & naming
- **About page seller count** — added `vacationMode: false`, `user: { banned: false }`, `listings: { some: { status: "ACTIVE" } }` filters. Added member count (`prisma.user.count({ where: { banned: false } })`).
- **Homepage stats bar** — added member count between "active makers" and "orders fulfilled".
- **"From Your Makers" → "Makers You Follow"** — renamed for clarity.

### Already done (no changes needed)
- Blog card hover states — already covered by `.card-listing:hover` CSS rule
- Upload error handling — R2UploadButton already has `uploadError` state with user-facing messages
- Fulfillment button gating — already working via status-based JSX visibility + route redirect

## Styling Consistency Pass (2026-04-22)

### Card surface unification
All card surfaces across the site now use the design system's `card-section` class (warm shadow + subtle border) instead of raw `border border-neutral-200 rounded-lg/xl`:
- **Dashboard orders** — order cards + empty state
- **Dashboard sales** — order cards + empty state
- **Messages inbox** — conversation list + empty state
- **Dashboard nav buttons** — all 12 buttons (Your Shop + Your Account), now with `hover:shadow-md transition-shadow`
- **Commission room** — empty state
- **Account page** — section empty states
- **Blog page** — featured card + no-results state

### Visual consistency fixes
- **Mosaic animation seam** — `translateX(-50%)` → `translateX(-50.05%)` in both keyframes. Sub-pixel overlap hides the vertical line where the duplicated row meets itself.
- **SearchBar button** — added `rounded-none` to the submit button. The outer `rounded-full overflow-hidden` container clips it; the global `button { border-radius }` rule was creating visible inner-left corners.
- **"Makers You Follow" cards** — `h-36` fixed height → `aspect-square`, `rounded-2xl overflow-hidden`, hover lift effect. Matches ListingCard modern look.
- **Meet a Maker featured listings** — added `hover:shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-1 transition-all` hover lift.

## Visual Polish — Hover Fix + Dividers + Dashboard (2026-04-22)

### ListingCard hover fix
Removed `hover:shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-1` from outer container. Hover now ONLY zooms the photo via `group-hover:scale-105`. No card emergence effect — text floats on the page background with no white card appearing around it. This matches the design intent of "floating cards" not "contained cards."

### Light dividers (site-wide)
All heavy default borders replaced with `border-neutral-100`:
- NotificationBell dropdown: header, list dividers, footer
- Messages inbox: conversation list dividers
- UserAvatarMenu dropdown: container, header, section separator
- Header hamburger drawer: top and bottom borders

### SearchBar button seamless
Added `style={{ borderRadius: 0 }}` inline on the submit button. The global `button { border-radius: 0.375rem }` CSS rule was overriding Tailwind's `rounded-none` in v4 cascade. Inline style guarantees no inner corners.

### Dashboard pages → card-section
- Analytics: all 14+ stat/chart/table containers
- Inventory: list containers + empty states + dividers
- Blog: post list + empty state
- Seller settings: Shop Updates section

### Mosaic seam
Increased overlap from `-50.05%` to `-50.1%` in both keyframes.

## Full Site Card/Divider Audit + Fixes (2026-04-22)

### Part A: Card-section applied to 15+ pages
Every remaining content container across the site now uses `card-section` or `card-listing` instead of raw `border border-neutral-200 rounded-xl`. All dividers use `border-neutral-100` (light grey) instead of default dark:

**Order pages**: buyer detail, seller detail, buyer list, seller list — all containers, receipt sections, item lists, case threads, fulfillment sections.
**Dashboard**: nav buttons, listing cards, profile form sections, FAQ items, featured listings.
**Account**: saved items (listings + blog posts), commissions, settings (all 8 preference sections).
**Public**: commission room, blog page (tag cloud, pagination), cart (seller sections, summary, dividers).
**Components**: FilterSidebar, MobileFilterBar (sheet headers, tag pills), NotificationBell (outer border removed — shadow only).

### Part B: Notification toggle mobile sizing
`NotificationToggle.tsx`: added `min-w-[44px] shrink-0` to prevent flexbox from compressing toggle buttons to varying sizes based on label text length on mobile.

### Part C: Message preview timestamp fix
New `MessageTime.tsx` client component replaces server-side `formatWhen()` in the messages inbox. Server-side `toLocaleString()` rendered UTC on Vercel — now renders in the user's local timezone. Also fixed `account/orders/page.tsx` timestamps with existing `LocalDate` component.

### Part D: Order list refund display
All three order list pages (buyer dashboard, seller sales, account orders) now show `Refund: -$X.XX` in red when `sellerRefundAmountCents > 0`. Added `sellerRefundAmountCents` to the account orders query.

### Part E: Refund max excludes tax
`SellerRefundPanel` now accepts `maxRefundCents` prop (items + shipping, excluding tax). Helper text added: "Tax is refunded automatically by Stripe in proportion to the refund amount." Seller sales detail page computes and passes the correct max.

## Final Polish Batch (2026-04-22)

### Styling
- **Notifications page** — `card-section` + `divide-neutral-100`
- **OrderTimeline** — `card-section` container
- **Order/sales item photos** — removed black border outline (kept rounded + object-cover)
- **Saved page** — "Back to My Account" link with ArrowLeft icon
- **Browse FilterSidebar** — consistent `rounded-md border border-neutral-200` on all inputs/selects, `accent-neutral-900` on radios, proper Apply/Reset button styling
- **List view thumbnails** — forced `aspect-square` on thumbnail containers (was non-square)
- **Featured blog card** — `aspect-[16/9] overflow-hidden` (was using original image proportions)
- **Cart mobile** — `flex-wrap gap-2` on price/qty/remove row + `shrink-0` on prices. Prevents overlap on large amounts.

### Functionality
- **Blog toolbar image upload** — Image button now opens a file picker, uploads to R2 via presign route, and inserts the public URL into the editor. Replaces the URL prompt. Link button unchanged.
- **Refund max** — restored full order total (items + shipping + tax) as the maximum refundable amount. Stripe allows refunding the full charge. Helper text about tax proportional refund kept.

### Alt Text for Images (SEO)
- **Schema**: `altText String?` added to both `Photo` and `ReviewPhoto` models. Migration: `20260422042621_add_photo_alt_text`.
- **ListingGallery** — main photo and lightbox use `photo.altText ?? title` for alt attribute.
- **Listing edit page** — alt text input field below each photo thumbnail. "Save alt texts" server action updates each photo's `altText` field. Ownership guard on the save action.
- **ActionForm** — `id` prop support added for form-attribute linking.

## Site-Wide Border Audit + Final Fixes (2026-04-22)

### Border color consistency (16 files, ~35 edits)
Every remaining bare `border-b`, `border-t`, and `divide-y` across the site now has an explicit color class. No more inherited dark borders:
- All dividers: `border-neutral-100` (light grey)
- All button/container borders: `border-neutral-200`
- Files fixed: listing detail, checkout success, seller profile, commission detail, admin pages (cases/flagged/orders/verification), blog detail, seller settings, dashboard verification, map, metro browse, browse, homepage, makers, profile edit, custom order form

### Message thread query limit
`take: 200` added to both `messages/[id]/page.tsx` and `api/messages/[id]/list/route.ts`. Prevents unbounded query on long conversations (was loading all messages with no limit).

### Blog image upload error handling
`MarkdownToolbar.tsx` image upload catch block now shows `alert("Image upload failed. The file may be too large (max 4MB).")` instead of silently failing.

### Server-side dates → LocalDate (3 files)
Replaced `toLocaleDateString()` with `LocalDate` client component in:
- `dashboard/orders/[id]`: shippedAt, estimatedDeliveryDate (3 instances)
- `dashboard/sales/[orderId]`: processingDeadline, estimatedDeliveryDate
- `seller/[id]`: vacation return date, broadcast date, blog post dates

## SEO Comprehensive Audit (2026-04-22)

### noindex on private pages (30 files)
Added `robots: { index: false, follow: false }` to all server component pages under `/dashboard/*` (17), `/account/*` (9), `/messages/*` (3), and `/checkout/success`. Prevents Google from indexing "Sign in required" pages and wasting crawl budget. Client components (`dashboard/analytics`, `cart`) are already blocked by `robots.txt` Disallow rules.

### Structured data additions
- **Homepage**: Organization JSON-LD (name, url, logo, description) + WebSite JSON-LD with SearchAction targeting `/browse?q={search_term_string}`. Enables Google sitelinks search box and brand knowledge panel.
- **Blog posts**: Article JSON-LD with headline, description, image, datePublished, dateModified, author (Person), publisher (Organization with logo). Enables rich snippets, Google Discover, and news carousel.
- **Listing detail**: Product availability now mapped dynamically — `InStock` (active + stock > 0), `OutOfStock` (sold out), `PreOrder` (made to order). Was hardcoded to "InStock" regardless of status.
- **Seller profile**: `aggregateRating` (ratingValue + reviewCount) added to LocalBusiness JSON-LD when reviews exist. `sameAs` array of social URLs (Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, TikTok, website) added.

### Sitemap additions
Added `/terms` (monthly, 0.3), `/privacy` (monthly, 0.3), `/map` (weekly, 0.5). `/blog` was already present.

### Alt text improvements
- Homepage Meet a Maker banner: `alt=""` → `alt="${displayName} workshop"`
- ListingGallery thumbnails: `alt=""` → `alt="${altText ?? title} — photo N"`

## Quality Score Ranking Infrastructure (2026-04-22)

### Schema
- `Listing.qualityScore Float @default(0)` — precomputed composite quality score
- Compound index `@@index([status, isPrivate, qualityScore])` for fast `ORDER BY qualityScore DESC` queries
- Migration: `20260422171857_add_quality_score`

### Scoring formula (`src/lib/quality-score.ts`)
8-factor weighted scoring with Bayesian dampening (C=50):

| Factor | Weight | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Conversion rate (dampened) | 25% | orders ÷ views, pulled to site mean when views < 50 |
| Seller rating | 20% | average rating / 5.0 |
| Favorites (normalized) | 15% | min(1, favCount / 50) |
| Recency | 15% | 1/(1 + ageDays/60) — hyperbolic, reaches 0.5 at 60 days |
| Click-through rate (dampened) | 10% | clicks ÷ views, pulled to site mean |
| Guild status | 5% | GUILD_MASTER=1.0, GUILD_MEMBER=0.6, NONE=0 |
| Photo completeness | 5% | min(1, photoCount/4) × (hasAltText ? 1.0 : 0.8) |
| Description completeness | 5% | min(1, descLength/200) |

**Bayesian dampening**: `dampened = (views × raw + C × globalMean) / (views + C)`. When a listing has few views, the score is pulled toward the site average. As views increase, the listing's actual rate dominates. This means the formula works correctly from 20 listings to 100K — noise is suppressed when data is sparse, real signals emerge as traffic grows.

### Cron job
- `GET /api/cron/quality-score` — recalculates all scores daily
- Schedule: `0 6 * * *` (6am UTC) in `vercel.json`
- CRON_SECRET auth (same safe pattern as other crons)
- Zeros out inactive/private listings

### Homepage sections
- **"New Arrivals"** (was "Fresh from the Workshop") — newest ACTIVE listings, `orderBy: createdAt desc`
- **"Top Picks"** (was "Collector Favorites") — `orderBy: qualityScore desc`. Shows the highest-quality listings based on the composite score.
- **"Makers You Follow"** — unchanged (personalized, follow-based)

### Browse relevance
- **No search query + relevance sort**: `ORDER BY qualityScore DESC` with standard Prisma pagination. Eliminates the 200-listing JS scoring limit. Every listing is ranked.
- **Search query + relevance sort**: fetch 200 candidates by qualityScore, then apply text-match bonuses (exact title +0.5, starts-with +0.3, contains +0.15, exact tag +0.2) in JS.

### Listing JSON-LD rating fallback
```
if (listing has reviews) → use listing rating
else if (seller has reviews) → use seller rating  
else → omit aggregateRating
```
Seller field in offers uses `Organization` type with profile URL.

### Scaling path
- **Current** (launch): formula works with sparse data via dampening. Conversion/CTR contribute minimally. Seller rating, favorites, recency drive ranking.
- **500+ listings**: conversion/CTR signals become meaningful for popular listings. Formula auto-adapts — no code changes.
- **10K+ listings**: consider adding `engagementScore` (favorites + views in last 7 days) for a "Trending" section.
- **100K+ listings**: consider hourly score updates for trending, daily for quality. Batch update via raw SQL instead of individual Prisma updates.

### RecentlyViewed styling
Updated to modern floating-text cards: `rounded-2xl overflow-hidden aspect-square`, no borders, photo hover zoom, text floating on page background.

### New Listing Bump + New Seller Bonus (2026-04-22)

Added to `qualityScore` formula in `src/lib/quality-score.ts`:

- **New listing bump**: +0.15 for the first 14 days, linear decay to 0 by day 30. Prevents new listings from being permanently buried by established ones. Mirrors Etsy's documented "new listing boost" approach.
- **New seller bonus**: additional +0.05 for sellers with zero reviews. First-time sellers need more visibility than established sellers adding their 50th listing. Disappears after first review.

Combined effect at launch:
- Brand-new seller's first listing: ~0.62 (competitive with established top sellers at ~0.70)
- After 14 days with no engagement: bump starts fading
- After 30 days: listing must stand on its own merits (rating, favorites, conversion)

Gaming risk analysis: relisting abuse (delete + recreate for permanent bump) is mitigated by AI review duplicate title detection, the 14-day window being too short to sustain, and the bump being additive (not multiplicative).

New Arrivals section on homepage now prefers listings from the last 30 days with fallback to newest if fewer than 6 recent results.

`sellerReviewCount` added to the quality score SQL query (used for the new seller bonus calculation).

### Browse Search — Word-Level Matching (2026-04-22)

**Before**: `ILIKE '%walnut dining table%'` — only matched if the exact phrase appeared in order. "Custom Walnut Table for Dining Room" would NOT match the query "walnut dining table."

**After**: query is split into individual words. Each word is matched independently against title, tags, and description via Prisma `OR` conditions. "walnut dining table" finds anything with "walnut" OR "dining" OR "table" in any field.

**WHERE clause**: per-word `contains` (ILIKE) on title + description, per-word exact tag match (`has`), partial tag matches via `ILIKE ANY(patterns)` on unnest, full-phrase match kept for exact-title bonus, seller name match kept.

**Scoring** (when search query exists):
- 60% text relevance: exact full-phrase title +0.5, full phrase in title +0.25, per-word in title +0.2, per-word exact tag +0.25, per-word partial tag +0.1, per-word in description +0.05. Normalized by term count.
- 40% qualityScore: among matching results, higher-quality listings rank first.

Search terms capped at 6 words. Partial tag unnest query now includes seller safety filters (chargesEnabled, vacationMode, banned).

## Photo Management + AI Alt Text + SEO + UX (2026-04-22)

### Photo management on create listing
New `PhotoManager` component (`src/components/PhotoManager.tsx`) replaces `ImagesUploader` on the create listing page:
- Upload photos via existing R2 pipeline
- Reorder with left/right arrow buttons
- Delete with X button
- "Cover" badge on first photo, "Make cover" button on others
- Alt text input per photo (max 200 chars, placeholder "Describe this image for SEO...")
- Hidden inputs serialize ordered URLs + alt texts as JSON for form submission
- Server action reads `imageAltTextsJson` and saves to `Photo.altText` on creation

### AI-generated alt text
`reviewListingWithAI` in `src/lib/ai-review.ts` now returns `altTexts?: string[]` — 10-20 word SEO-friendly descriptions per image. GPT-4o-mini already receives images for safety review; alt text is near-zero additional cost (~$0.00015/image). After listing creation, AI alt texts backfill photos that have no seller-provided alt text. Seller's manual alt text always takes priority. `max_tokens` increased from 300 to 500 to accommodate the alt text array.

### Review JSON-LD (SEO)
Top 5 reviews added to Product JSON-LD on listing detail pages. Each review includes `Review` type with author, datePublished, reviewRating, and reviewBody (truncated to 200 chars). Enables Google's review carousel in search results.

### FAQ schema on commission pages (SEO)
`FAQPage` JSON-LD on `/commission` with 3 Q&As: how commissions work, pricing, timelines. Enables Google's FAQ rich snippets (expandable Q&A in search results).

### Blog search by maker
Clicking a maker name in blog search suggestions now navigates to `?author=sellerProfileId` (was text search by name only). Blog page filters by `sellerProfileId` when the `author` URL param is present. Suggestions API returns `sellerProfileId` for author-type suggestions.

### Gift wrap display in cart
Gift wrapping now shows as a separate line item in the cart order summary (shipping step) with the total cost across all sellers. Previously the price was only shown in the GiftNoteSection toggle.

### Section rename
"Stories from the Workshop" → "From the Blog" on the homepage.

### Notification preferences split
Settings page (`/account/settings`) now has two distinct sections:
- **"Your notifications"** (all users): From Makers You Follow, Orders & Cases, buyer email prefs
- **"Shop notifications"** (sellers only): Your Shop, Blog, seller email prefs
`CUSTOM_ORDER_LINK` and `COMMISSION_INTEREST` moved from seller to buyer section (they're buyer-facing notifications).
