# Grainline Closed Audit Findings

This is the active closed-finding tracker for the current hardening program.
`CLOSED_AUDIT_HISTORY.md` remains the long historical archive, and
`audit_open_findings.md` remains the live ledger that may include fixed,
deferred, stale, and open findings for traceability.

## Counter Rules

- Count only verified findings, hardening fixes, or explicitly clean audited
  surfaces.
- Do not count Claude-reported issues until Codex verifies them against `main`.
- Report progress as `verified closed / verified candidate total` once a
  Claude batch has a triaged denominator.
- Until a Claude batch is fully triaged, report the denominator as `pending`
  instead of pretending the raw claim count is real.
- Record whether each entry had code changes, docs-only evidence, or was a
  stale/false-positive audit claim.

## 2026-05-14 Active Tracker

1. **Account deletion media cleanup scoped to deleted uploader** — code fix.
   Prevents one deleted account from removing another user's first-party media
   by referencing copied public URLs. Commit: `0408673`.
2. **Commission reference uploads use buyer-safe endpoint** — code fix.
   Non-seller commission buyers now use `messageImage` instead of seller-only
   `listingImage`. Commit: `75aa56f`.
3. **Message attachment upload rules match image/PDF UX** — code fix.
   `messageAny` allows images/PDFs only; `messageFile` allows PDFs only.
   Commit: `acccc42`.
4. **Public forms/webhooks/payment scripts/XSS surfaces recorded clean** —
   docs-only audited surface. Commit: `afa18da`.
5. **Blog notification side-effect failures captured** — code fix. Admin blog
   comment approval and maker blog follower fanout now emit bounded Sentry
   evidence. Commit: `3b7c325`.
6. **Central email telemetry hashes recipients** — code fix. Raw `to` and raw
   subject values no longer go to Sentry extras from `src/lib/email.ts`.
   Commit: `f1b26f0`.
7. **Profanity telemetry avoids raw matched terms** — code fix. Moderation logs
   now emit bounded IDs and match counts instead of submitted words. Commit:
   `4589725`.
8. **Notification read-state writes fail closed** — code fix. Mark-read routes
   now use fail-closed rate limiting. Commit: `c043279`.
9. **Authenticated account-state routes tightened** — code fix. Favorites now
   honor reciprocal block state before writes/notifications; saved-search and
   shipping-address reads are bounded earlier. Commit: `d36ecba`.
10. **Public blog search inputs bounded** — code fix. Blog search now bounds
    page/limit/tags before Prisma/raw SQL; suggestions use shared query
    normalization and fuzzy threshold constants. Commit: `99e47ff`.
11. **API query pagination/timestamps centralized and bounded** — code fix.
    `page`, `limit`, and message `since` params now use shared helpers before
    Prisma `skip`/`take`/date filters across blog, commission, account feed,
    seller broadcast history, and message polling. Public commission reads now
    share the public search IP limiter. Commit: `fix: centralize api query bounds`.
12. **Fail-open limiter policy tightened** — code fix. `safeRateLimitOpen()` is
    now regression-limited to telemetry, diagnostics, and support/legal
    escalation. Public newsletter, account feed, blog/search APIs, recently
    viewed, global search suggestions, and public commission reads fail closed
    before Prisma/raw SQL work when Redis limiting is unavailable. Commit:
    `fix: tighten fail-open limiter policy`.
13. **Public form/report body reads bounded** — code fix. Public newsletter,
    support, legal data-request, and CSP report routes now read through
    `readBoundedJson()` / `readBoundedText()` before parsing or Sentry
    processing, with route-specific byte caps and streamed-body enforcement.
    Commit: `fix: bound public request bodies`.
14. **Signed webhook raw body reads bounded** — code fix. Stripe snapshot,
    Stripe v2 thin, Clerk, and Resend webhook routes now read through
    `readBoundedText()` before vendor signature verification, with
    route-specific byte caps and bounded telemetry for oversized payloads.
    Commit: `fix: bound signed webhook bodies`.
15. **Rendering/XSS guardrails tightened** — code fix. JSON-LD and blog
    markdown rendering were verified behind safe serializers/sanitizers, and
    remaining target-blank links now use explicit `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
    Commit: `fix: tighten rendering security guardrails`.
16. **Authenticated JSON mutation body reads bounded** — code fix. Checkout,
    shipping quote, direct upload presign/verify, seller broadcast, admin
    email, user report, case, review, custom-order, and commission JSON
    mutations now use `readBoundedJson()` with route-specific caps before Zod
    parsing and downstream side effects. Commit: `fix: bound authenticated json
    mutations`.
17. **All API JSON body reads bounded** — code fix. Remaining smaller JSON
    readers now use `readBoundedJson()` or `readOptionalBoundedJson()` and the
    regression test recursively scans every API route to prevent raw
    `req.json()` / `request.json()` from returning. Commit: `fix: bound
    remaining api json reads`.
18. **API form-data body pre-checks added** — code fix. Processed image upload,
    order fulfillment form fallback, and unsubscribe form fallback now run
    `assertContentLengthUnder()` before `formData()` parsing when
    `Content-Length` is present. Commit: `fix: precheck api form data bodies`.
19. **Public API auth inventory and similar-listing limiter** — code fix.
    Unauthenticated API routes are regression-allowlisted, and the public
    similar-listings endpoint now fails closed through `searchRatelimit` before
    Prisma/raw-SQL work. Commit: `fix: rate-limit public similar listings`.
20. **API read amplification limiter sweep** — code fix. Optional-public GET
    routes that do Prisma work before requiring auth now use the public
    `searchRatelimit`, and heavier signed-in fan-out reads for cart contents,
    message history, notifications, and seller analytics now use dedicated
    fail-closed read limiters before Prisma work. Commit: `fix: rate-limit api read fanouts`.
21. **Empty message-thread submissions blocked server-side** — code fix. Forged
    message-thread server-action posts with no text and no valid attachments
    now return an error before conversation lookup/update work, and
    message-email failures from that action emit bounded Sentry evidence.
    Commit: `fix: reject empty message sends`.
22. **Seller listing server actions rate-limited** — code fix. Dashboard
    status/archive actions and public-shop listing actions now use
    `listingMutationRatelimit` before ownership DB lookups, so forged server
    action posts cannot hammer listing state transitions. Commit: `fix: rate-limit listing server actions`.
23. **Settings and notification server actions rate-limited** — code fix.
    Profile/shop/onboarding settings mutations now use `sellerProfileRatelimit`
    before seller/profile DB work, and notification mark-all-read uses
    `markReadRatelimit` plus a local banned/deleted guard. Commit: `fix: rate-limit settings server actions`.
24. **Non-admin server-action mutation sweep rate-limited** — code fix.
    Blocked-user unblocks, dashboard blog deletes, custom-listing creation,
    listing edit saves, and dashboard Guild applications now use local
    fail-closed limiters before DB/form/metrics work. Commit: `fix: rate-limit remaining user server actions`.

## Verified Stale / Not Fixed

1. **Report target access gap** — stale claim. Current `main` already requires
   reporter access for private order/message/thread/listing report targets and
   has guardrail coverage in `tests/user-report-target-access.test.mjs`.
